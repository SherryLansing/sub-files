2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,660
好吧 我觉得我可以这么说
All right, I think I'm allowed to say this

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,685
所以我做视频已经超过15年了
so I've been making videos for like 15 plus years now

4
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:13,067
但在YouTube上 有些事情实际上让人意外
and there's something actually kind of counterintuitive

5
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:14,789
在YouTube上
that happens on YouTube

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:22,036
人们反而更喜欢低制作价值的视频
where people are more drawn to Almost like lower production value videos

7
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,977
比如那些大灯光的内容
like obviously big lights

8
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:25,559
当然 摄像机等设备都很有趣
and cameras and everything are super fun

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,326
不过 人们更想看到真实的生活
and but people just want to see real life

10
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:30,446
就是用你手边的任何相机拍摄的现实场景
like what's happening in front of you

11
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,046

with whatever camera you have with you.

12
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,387
所以 尽管我对视频制作非常痴迷
So while I'm a huge video nerd

13
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:35,207
我已经换过几台相机
and I've graduated a few times from,

14
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,748
从我的第一台普通相机到第一台单反相机
you know, my first camera to my first DSLR

15
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,349
再到一台电影摄影机
to a cinema camera

16
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:43,710
而这些相机其实用起来变得越来越复杂
and these cameras actually get like harder and harder to use

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,131
但我真的想回归到随意拍摄 去更多的地方
but I actually want to get back more into shooting just like more places,

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,872
更多自发地去获取经历和探索不同的地方
just more spontaneously and more experiences and more locations

19
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:55,538
而不仅仅是我们擅长的那种面对镜头的说话类型
not just the talking head stuff that we've gotten really good at.

20
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:56,559
这确实还是挺有趣的 不过
It's still fun, but like

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,121
我们想要更多地出去走走 你懂吗？
we want to just get out more, you know?

22
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,164
总之 那些设备的最佳选择是
So anyway, the sort of apex for that gear is

23
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,265
你可能会以为我说的是智能手机
you might have thought I was going to say smartphones

24
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,566
其实我说的是像这样的运动相机
but it's like an action camera like this

25
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:08,668
而且它甚至更小了
like it's even smaller.

26
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:09,629
它随时都能陪着你
It can go everywhere with you.

27
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,308
它更加坚固耐用
It's more rugged.

28
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:12,590
它随时都能拍摄到所有内容
It can shoot everything all the time.

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,293
这让我思考
And that got me thinking, well

30
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,915
我接触这些运动相机已经快10年了
it's been almost 10 years since I got into these action cameras

31
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,857
那么 现在最好的运动相机有多厉害呢？
and How good are the best ones now?

32
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,738
你可能还记得那天我们把相机绑在Mac身上的场景
Like you might remember when we strapped one onto Mac that one day

33
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:28,099
那时我用4K摄像机记录了狗的视角 时间是2014年
and got the perspective of being a dog in 4K. That was 2014.

34
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,938
所以和那个类似
So similar to that

35
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:31,299
这次也不是评测
this one also isn't a review

36
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,941
这次是大疆赞助的 他们送来了这个
but this one is sponsored by DJI and they've got this,

37
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,182
这是他们最新的高端运动相机 Action 5 Pro
their newest, latest and greatest, highest end action camera into my hands.

38
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,483
所以这就是大疆的Action 5 Pro
So this is the Action 5 Pro.

39
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:44,703
我打算用它深入探索希望能带来更多可能的技术
And I figured I'd use this to take a deeper look at the tech

40
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:45,504
希望能
that's gonna hopefully

41
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:48,804
让我能进行更多自由风格的拍摄
enable more of this more freestyle shooting that I do.

42
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:49,604
预计在2025年
in 2025.

43
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,545
运动相机明显的第一个优点就是
So the first obvious advantage of the action camera

44
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,665
它非常耐用
is just how tough it's built

45
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:53,525

because yes

46
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,667
智能手机录制视频表现出色
we know smartphones can do an incredible job with video too

47
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:57,907
但我想你一定会有不同的看法
but I don't know about you.

48
00:01:57,907 --> 00:02:01,647
我可不想在这种危险情况下拿我的手机冒险
I'm just not trying to risk my phone and all these precarious scenarios

49
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:03,188
或者找到一个好角度拍摄会很不错
or it would be cool to get an angle

50
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,388
你只需把相机放在某个地方就可以了
or you put the camera someplace

51
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,150
那里可能会掉下或被撞到
where it could fall or get smacked around

52
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,069
要是我的手机碰了一下可就麻烦了
or take a beating because that's my phone.

53
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,971
这一点从一开始就是不争的事实
So this has always been true since the beginning.

54
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,651
这台设备完全防水
I mean, this thing is airtight.

55
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,991
它的外形就像坦克一样坚固
It's built like a tank.

56
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:17,526
无需保护套 防水深度达20米
It's waterproof to 20 meters with no case needed.

57
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,287
比很多智能手机更出色
much better than most smartphones.

58
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,748
而且它的耐温性也很强
And then it's also super temperature resistant.

59
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:27,491
工作温度范围为零下20℃到45℃
So it can operate anywhere from negative 20 Celsius to 45 Celsius.

60
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,052
我会在屏幕上显示华氏温度
I'll also put the Fahrenheit on the screen for y'all

61
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:31,935
在这些温度下不会有结冰或过热的问题
but no freezing or overheating in any of these temperatures

62
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,976
这可真是太疯狂了
which is kind of nuts.

63
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:35,757
所以更耐用、更小巧的特点
So being more durable and smaller than any smartphone

64
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,198
在很多情况下是明显的优势
is a pretty obvious advantage

65
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,839
在多种场景中 这对运动相机来说是个明显的优点
to the action camera in a lot of situations.

66
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,181
不过这些设备在使用上经过多年的改进
But the other thing about these things is they've gotten a lot

67
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,282
在可用性上的提升
of usability upgrades

68
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:43,801
变得更加实用了
over the years.

69
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,583
我记得以前的日子
So I remember back in the day

70
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,366
以前这些相机只有单一的后屏幕
these used to just be back screens

71
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,787
有点像是要瞄准的感觉
which is kind of like point

72
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:52,367
然后就拍摄 希望一切顺利
and shoot and cross your fingers if you're on the other side.

73
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:56,128
不过现在 它们都有了双屏设计
But now, now they've all got these dual screens.

74
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,349
前后都有屏幕
So you've got a screen on the front and on the back

75
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,371
这在任意方向构图时非常方便
which is really convenient for framing things up in either direction.

76
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:06,171
而且这个型号还配备了高亮度的OLED屏幕
And this one also happens to have these high brightness OLED screens.

77
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:08,712
所以即使在户外或者很亮的环境下
So even if it's outside or something super bright

78
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:10,394
我可以同时使用两个屏幕
I can use both screens.

79
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,974
而且这是一个触控屏 非常好用
And since it's a touchscreen and it's actually usable

80
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,775
我可以方便地切换设置
I can flip through settings

81
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,239
并调整设置 确保我的构图合适
and adjust things and get my framing right.

82
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,500
无论是哪一侧
on either side.

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,580
其实这非常实用
It's actually very useful.

84
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,002
所以这在其他方面也有了提升
So this actually levels up in one other way.

85
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:24,705
它有个我觉得应该更普遍的功能
It has a feature that I think should be more common than it is

86
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,366
就是内置存储空间
which is internal storage.

87
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:31,550
这款相机内置了47个GB的存储空间
So this camera has 47 gigs of internal storage.

88
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,051
等一下 祖里
Hold on, Zuri.

89
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:34,592
这就意味着我已经因此省了好几次心
Which means it saved me a couple times already

90
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:36,815
因为我忘了去拿内存卡
where I forget to go get a memory card

91
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,896
但我内置的存储足够用来录制视频
but I still have enough storage built in to record.

92
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,619
我希望所有相机都有这个功能
Petition for all cameras to have that.

93
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,599
我觉得它们应该都这样
I think they should all do it.

94
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,102
它们应该都有内置录制功能 这样就能随时录制
They should all have internal recording so they can just record whenever.

95
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:45,882
如果我有卡的话
And if I have a card

96
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,239
那么我可以录得更多
then I can record more.

97
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,660
这样就足够了……
So this will do...

98
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,220
这是47个G的容量
This is 47 gigs.

99
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,561
时长为两个小时
It's two hours.

100
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,401
我可以用一段时间了
I'm good for a while.

101
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,983
好吧 去自在地探索吧
Alright, run free.

102
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,004
去好好探索吧
Go explore.

103
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,345
电池续航表现非常出色
Battery life is very solid.

104
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,387
如果把屏幕关掉 连续录制四个小时
Up to four hours non-stop recording if you turn the screen off.

105
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:04,569
而大疆的无人机也配有类似的智能充电器
And then DJI has a similar clever charger that they have with their drones.

106
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,312
也就是说 把所有电池放进这个充电盒
Basically where if you put all of the batteries in this case

107
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,013
然后为盒子充电
and then charge the case

108
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,274
它会逐一给它们充电
it just hops each of them up.

109
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:13,034
相机会快速充电
And the camera itself actually will quick charge

110
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:13,836
只需直接连接即可
if you just plug it right in

111
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,556
USB-C
with the USB-C.

112
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,064
我不知道功率是多少 但是……
I don't have a wattage, but...

113
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,507
我插电开始时电量为0% 四分钟充到了20%
I plugged it in at zero and it got to 20% in four minutes

114
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:20,728
然后40分钟后充满电
and then it was full in 40.

115
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,189
此外 还配有压力传感器
There's also a pressure sensor

116
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:25,132
可以随时显示你在水下的深度
so you can tell at any time how deep underwater you are

117
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,254
或者你当前的海拔高度
or how high of an altitude you're at

118
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,875
如果你对此拍摄感兴趣的话
if that's what you're interested in shooting.

119
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,358
而且还有很多配件
And also then there's just a bunch of accessories for it

120
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,341
可以帮助你拍摄各种角度
for building out and shooting whatever angle

121
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,963
你想拍摄什么都可以
whatever subject you want.

122
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,726
所以可能像这样的奇怪东西吧
So maybe something kind of weird like this.

123
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,127
等我一下下
Give me a second.

124
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:50,843
我通常不太敢把手机放在
I would normally not at all be comfortable putting my phone out

125
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:52,646
面前
in front of me

126
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:53,925
像这样挥杆打高尔夫
hitting golf balls like this,

127
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,668
不过这个角度还蛮酷的
but kind of cool angle.

128
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,314
这款相机最棒的特点是
Probably one of the best things about this camera is it attaches

129
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:07,096
可以连接各种配件
to any accessory

130
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:07,516

you want

131
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,598
通过底部的磁性快拆系统 很方便
by this magnetic quick release system at the bottom

132
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,680
在过去的几年里 这款设备已经相对标准化了
which has been pretty standardized with this thing for the past few years.

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,154
我觉得其他公司也开始陆续跟进了
I think other companies are starting to follow along too.

134
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:18,237
说实话 这款的好处在于
Matter of fact, the benefits of this one specifically

135
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,158
因为它是大疆出品
since it's made by DJI

136
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:24,122
它可以直接与大疆其他产品兼容
it's directly compatible with other things DJI also makes,

137
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,764
例如他们最新的麦克风 Mic 2
like their newest mics, the Mic 2.

138
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,687
所以你可以很方便地直接将它与运动相机配对
So you can pair that easily straight to the action cam

139
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,430
而且可以从内置麦克风获取音频
and get scratch audio from the built-in microphones.

140
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,269
除此之外
On top of all of that

141
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,572
它实际上可以即插即用 作为网络摄像头
it actually plug and plays as a webcam.

142
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:36,593
所以 当你插上的时候
So when you plug it in

143
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:40,350
在选项中选择网络摄像头
the options come up, select webcam,

144
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,971
这确实提升了很多人的使用体验
and actually levels up a lot of people's webcam experiences

145
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,072
这真是太棒了
which is pretty sick.

146
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,374
使用前记得把它擦干净
Just remember to brush the dust off of it before you actually do.

147
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:49,134
但画质一定要好
But it's got to look good.

148
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:51,095
其实这一切的意义在于
Like the whole point of this is

149
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:52,935
你可以随时携带这台相机
that you have this camera everywhere with you

150
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,036
但拍摄的画面得好看
but that the footage actually looks good.

151
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:58,119
如果画面不好 前面说的一切都没意义
So none of this matters if the footage doesn't look good.

152
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,079
所以这款2024年的运动相机算得上是最好的
So this action cam in 2024 has one of the best.

153
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,822
它配备了1/1.3英寸的传感器 支持120帧每秒的4K录制
It has a 1 over 1.3 inch sensor that can shoot up to 4K at 120 FPS

154
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,557
如果想的话 可以用慢动作拍摄
slow-mo if you want to.

155
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,519
现在有几款高端智能手机
There are a couple other high-end smartphones out right now

156
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,959
传感器差不多大小
with roughly the same size sensor.

157
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,142
我觉得1/1.3英寸的传感器和Galaxy S23 Ultra是相同的
I actually think 1 over 1.3 inches is the same as the Galaxy S23 Ultra

158
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,744
所以这是个很好的例子
so that's a good example.

159
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:20,286
所以 F2.8镜头足够大 可以收集很多光线
So big enough to gather plenty of light is an F2.8 lens.

160
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,166
而且
And on top of that

161
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,088
因为它是一款专用相机
since it's a dedicated camera, yes

162
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,348
它支持拍摄log格式
it can shoot log.

163
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,490
它配备了10位D-Log M格式
It's got a 10-bit D-Log M.

164
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,132
它具备HLG功能
It's got HLG so

165
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,853
你可以获得更多的动态范围
that you can get even more dynamic range

166
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:32,677
这让你在后期编辑时有更多选择
to mess with in editing after the fact.

167
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,557
当然你也可以选择普通拍摄模式
Of course, you can always just shoot normal mode if you want

168
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,918
不过如果你需要更大的动态范围
but if you ever want that extra range

169
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,478
在触摸屏上轻松一滑就能切换
it's just a quick flip away on the touchscreen settings.

170
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,358
它的视角非常广阔
And it has one of the widest fields of view.

171
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,180
运动相机的特点是视角极广
This is the thing about action cameras is they get super wide

172
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,740
不过这款相机拥有155度的视角
but this one is 155 degrees.

173
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,201
这给你提供了广阔的拍摄空间
So it gives you a ton of room to work with

174
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,182
如果你想拍摄超广角模式的话
if you want to shoot in the most ultra-wide mode

175
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:53,343
但是裁剪模式的失真更少了
but there's also less distortion in the more cropped modes

176
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,783
这要看你拍摄的内容
depending on what you're shooting.

177
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,485
其实拍摄像驾驶这样的一人称视角完全足够宽
It's actually plenty wide enough to shoot first-person stuff like driving,

178
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,161
比如在正常模式下或驾驶时
for example, in normal mode, or driving.

179
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:02,661
比如说
for example.

180
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:04,863
无需失真效果
No distortion needed.

181
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,045
接下来 我要谈的最后一点是
So that brings me to my last point

182
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,886
也就是物超所值
which is just bang for the buck.

183
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,507
像这样的小相机 可以随身带着
Like a tiny camera like this that you can take everywhere

184
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:14,249
比你冒险用的智能手机便宜多了
is going to be cheaper than a smartphone that you put at risk

185
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:16,250
你花在手机上的时间
all the time that you actually use for your phone.

186
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,456
这款相机起售价349块钱
So this camera, starts at 349 bucks.

187
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,798
而且不要忘了它的内置存储
And also let's not forget the internal storage that it comes with.

188
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:23,718
你可以挑一款来试试
So you can pick one of these up

189
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,418
还有各种配件和支架
and however many accessories and mounts

190
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,459
随便带上你需要的东西 出去玩
and things you want and run around outside

191
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,858
你可以随意使用 让它冒风险
and beat it up and put it at risk all the time.

192
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:30,759
到最后
And then at the end of the day

193
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,478
如果它还好好的
if it's still fine

194
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,259
把它带回来 想用的时候可以做网摄
bring it back and use it as a webcam if you want.

195
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,180
从这些小相机带来的乐趣中 我的主要收获是
So I think the main thing that I've taken away from all the fun

196
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,641
从这些小相机带来的乐趣中 我的主要收获是
that I've had with these little cameras is, you know

197
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:43,541
有句名言说
there's that famous quote

198
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,380
谁说的我也忘了
I don't know who said it

199
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,482
最好的相机 就是随身携带的那台
but the best camera is the one you have with you.

200
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:48,399
这句话到处可闻
You always hear that quoted everywhere.

201
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,841
我也越来越认同这句话
And I think I've been leaning into that more

202
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:56,384
因为我经常没有带着相机
because of how often I don't have my camera with me,

203
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,685
比如那种电影相机
like the cinema camera,

204
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,045
那台超级高端的红色相机
the super high end, the red camera.

205
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:04,088
我能想起很多这样的例子 例如
There are a ton of instances that I can recall of like, say

206
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,067
我正在进行一项科技评测
I'm doing a tech review

207
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,689
设备上发生了一些很酷的事情
and there's something really cool that happens on a device

208
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,550
或者是一种用手机拍摄的场景
or maybe like a shooting scenario with a smartphone camera.

209
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,113
我可以事后跟你说发生了什么
And I can kind of just tell you after the fact about what happened

210
00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:16,774
而不是用相机指着它给你看
instead of actually having the camera to point at it and show you.

211
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,098
我想更经常带着相机
I want to just have the camera with me more often

212
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,920
这样我就能把东西展示给你
and just be able to show you the thing.

213
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,180
但我并不是说
So what I'm definitely not saying is

214
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,543
我可没打算放弃那些高端相机
that I'm like done with, you know, the super high end fun cameras.

215
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,423
我还是很喜欢它们
I still love them.

216
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,485
我们为什么总是用红色相机在摄影棚拍摄 是有原因的
There's a reason why we shoot so much stuff with the Reds and in the studio

217
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:32,785
而这种拍摄方式始终有其价值
and that will always have its place.

218
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:37,967
但我今后特别希望能更频繁地随身带相机
But what my goal is going forward especially is to have the camera

219
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,769

with me more often.

220
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,269
当然 我口袋里会放着手机
Obviously I'll have my smartphone in my pocket

221
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,351
而我希望随身始终带着相机
but just having a camera all the time everywhere whether it's in my pocket

222
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,211
不论是在包里还是其他地方
or in my bag or whatever so

223
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,634
这样一旦有拍摄机会 我就能抓住它
that when that shooting scenario comes up I can capture it

224
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:52,254
而这些画面可以放进视频里
and that can actually go in the video.

225
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,634
这正是我想做的
That's what I'm trying to do.

226
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,416
希望你能理解我说的这些
Hopefully you're with me on that

227
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,197
也希望你能期待这些视频的上线
and hopefully you're down to see those videos when they come out.

228
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,317
你想看那段视频的话
Also if you want to see that video

229
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:02,119
很快会在自动对焦频道上线
that'll be on the Autofocus channel pretty soon.

230
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,461
非常疯狂的视频哦
Pretty crazy one.

231
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,244
那么 欢迎在评论区告诉我你的想法哦
Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments.
