1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:03,412
虚幻引擎 流行的游戏开发平台
Unreal Engine, a popular game development platform

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:06,235
刚刚推出了一项令人惊叹的新功能
just dropped something truly insane.

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:10,159
它拥有令人惊叹的众多功能
It is chock full of absolutely amazing features.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,181
而这就是所有功能中最出色的
And this is the best of them all.

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,062
它的名字是Megalite
It is called Megalite.

6
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:18,867
接下来 让我们来看看这个令人兴奋的功能集合
Then we look at this insane collection of features that are in the works.

7
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:22,370
Megalite可以利用这些创造虚拟世界
Megalites can create virtual worlds with these.

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,811
哇 这是真的吗？
Ooh, am I seeing correctly?

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,551
我简直不敢相信！
I cannot believe it!

10
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:31,513
这些光源有着细腻的纹理 优雅地为环境添彩
These are textured aerial lights beautifully coloring their surroundings

11
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:35,294
而我另一个最爱的则是那柔和的阴影
and my other favorite, beautiful soft shadows.

12
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:39,035
好的 我们知道这过程非常漫长 之前也是这样
Okay, we know that this takes forever, as previously

13
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:42,936
我们之前需要进行一个非常慢的光线模拟
we needed to run a super slow light simulation for this

14
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:46,617
并等待这些讨厌的噪音消除
and wait for all this nasty noise to clean up.

15
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,659
这需要多长时间？
So, how long does this take?

16
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,203
嗯 这个并不是提前计算的
Well, this was not computed in advance, yes

17
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:55,306
你现在看到的就是实时运行的效果
you are seeing it running in real time.

18
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,107
太震撼了！
That is mind-blowing.

19
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:57,848
哇！
Wow.

20
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:01,692
现在 我只需要一台能够运行这个的电脑
Now, I just need a PC that would be able to run this thing

21
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:04,754
那么我们就进入这个黑市吧
so let's enter this shady marketplace.

22
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:08,998
他们可能在卖掉某些灰色来源的Nvidia显卡
Perhaps they are selling Nvidia cards that have fallen off the truck.

23
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,081
这可不容易找
They are not easy to come by.

24
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,040
我们买一个试试吧
Let's buy one.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,382
嗯 等一下
Hmm, wait a minute.

26
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:16,102
这个市场一点儿都不阴险
This marketplace is not shady at all.

27
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,144
这里的灯光很多 十分绚丽
There are many beautiful lights

28
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,343
但总感觉缺少了什么
but something is missing.

29
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:21,685
那究竟缺少了什么？
What is missing?

30
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:25,025
当然 要有合理的阴影计算
Of course, a proper computation of shadows.

31
00:01:25,025 --> 00:01:27,507
那么 现在打开它
And now, turn it on, yes

32
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:30,768
现在我们有了一个真正的阴暗市场
we got a proper shady marketplace now.

33
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:34,390
我出生在共产主义的匈牙利 信不信？
I can tell, I was born in communist Hungary, trust me.

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,991
现在重点是 各种闪烁的灯光和油灯随处可见
Now, the point is that there are all kinds of flickering lights, oil lamps

35
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,953
可想而知 灯光真的是多得不可思议
everything that you can imagine, So many lights

36
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:45,416
艺术家们不必再担心减少灯光
because the artists don't have to worry about cutting lights

37
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,217
来保证游戏流畅
to make the game run well.

38
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:49,058
就把所有东西都塞进去
Just cram everything in there.

39
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,120
有点像期末考一样
Kind of like a final exam.

40
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,381
好 我们可以开始了
And there we go.

41
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,903
现在 学者们 把你们的纸拿稳
Now, hold on to your papers, fellow scholars

42
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:57,065
看看有多少啊
and look at how many there are.

43
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:57,905
哇 太神奇了！
Wow.

44
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,167
超过一千个光源！
Over 1000 light sources

45
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,370
每个光源都为场景投下独特的阴影
each casting their own shadows onto the scene.

46
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,912
就像一场更酷炫的文艺派对
It's like a rave, but nerdier.

47
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:07,555
彻底颠覆了游戏的规则！
A complete game changer.

48
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:08,895
而且 这还不止于此
But not only that

49
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,498
虚幻引擎还应用于电影、广播、
Unreal is also used in the movie industry, broadcasting,

50
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,760
产品可视化等各个领域 真是无所不包！
product visualization, you name it.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,043
与他们的模拟引擎结合
Pair it up with their simulation engine

52
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,965
简直完美！
which is also chef's kiss

53
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:21,227
这就是一个精彩绝伦的组合！
and you have an incredible package.

54
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:23,508
这些结果真是太惊艳了
These results are so beautiful

55
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:25,911
我简直不敢相信 我的眼睛都要看呆了
I thought my eyes are going to fall out.

56
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,991
但说真的 发生了什么事情啊？
But seriously, what is happening?

57
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,532
差不多一年内
In approximately a year

58
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:33,834
他们展示了Nanite 能让游戏拥有惊人的细节
they showcased Nanite for insane level geometry for games

59
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:38,937
接着是Lumen 带来了真实的反射 这在一年内就出现了两个光影领域的圣杯
and then Lumen for realistic reflections, two Holy Grails in one year

60
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:41,617
现在再加上Megalights 就变成三项了！
and now with Megalights, make it three.

61
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:45,739
这些动态灯光竟然能够实时渲染 真是太疯狂了！
It's crazy that these moving lights are rendered in real time.

62
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,721
而且对大多数人来说 这一切竟然都是免费的！
And all this is free for most people.

63
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,422
而且我们还没结束 离完结还差得远呢！
And we are not done yet, not even close.

64
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,242
我特别注意到的九件事
Here are 9 things that really caught my eye.

65
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,182
1.
1.

66
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:59,705
他们的动画引擎能让角色与几何形状完美结合
Their animation engine adapts these characters to geometry so well

67
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,848
甚至可以用来制作跑酷模拟
you can even make a parkour simulation with it

68
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,209
看看这些角色吧
and look at them

69
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,531
你甚至无需为他们的保险担心
you don't even need to pay their insurance premiums.

70
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,573
2. 变形制作如今更加简单快捷
2. Making deformations are now so much easier and quicker.

71
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:12,533
3.
3.

72
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:17,776
你不仅可以扭曲空间 还能扭曲时间 从而更好地编辑动画
You can not only warp space, but time too for better editing of animations.

73
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:22,180
4. 角色自定义如今无与伦比
4. Character customization is now second to none.

74
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,825
从加州沙滩风格到赛博朋克再到黄仁勋风格 各种选择应有尽有
Where we go from California Beachbody to Cyberpunk to Jensen Huang apparel.

75
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,967
他们还细心处理了许多细节
And they also took care of details

76
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:33,889
比如自动将裤子塞进靴子
like tucking the pants into boots automatically.

77
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:33,889
5.
5.

78
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:37,175
我听你说 卡罗利博士
I hear you say, Dr. Károly

79
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,878
我的模拟效果在哪里？AI又在哪里？
where are my simulations and where is the AI?

80
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,181
好 它就在这里
Well, it is right here.

81
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,104
问吧 学者们 答案就在这里
Ask and you shall receive, fellow scholars.

82
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:51,590
没错 这里的变形细致到每根肌肉
Yup, here the deformations go down to the level of individual muscles.

83
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,450
太疯狂了！
Insanity.

84
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,395
6.
6.

85
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:58,800
现在车辆可以定制 不过别太狂哦！
Vehicles can be customized now, but don't go too crazy or ouch.

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,881
7. 你还记得这个吗？
7. Remember this?

87
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:02,163
这不仅仅是一个简单的展示
This was not just a visualization,

88
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:08,988
而是新款宝马5系的数字副本 配有20,000个零件
but a digital copy of the new BMW 5 Series with 20,000 parts.

89
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:12,790
我本该说你甚至可以把它打开 可你看看！
I would say you can even pop it open, but look!

90
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,092
这真是世纪的低调表述
Understatement of the century.

91
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,874
连擎天柱都会感到惊艳
Even Optimus Prime would be impressed.

92
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,055
哇 真是惊人！
Wow. 8.

93
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:23,235
更好的动作捕捉支持 让角色的动作更加真实
Better motion capture support for more realistic character motion.

94
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:23,396
还有第9个功能
And 9.

95
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,517
这是我最喜欢的功能之一
This is one of my favorites.

96
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,999
通常 创造一个庞大的游戏虚拟世界时
Normally, when you create a vast virtual world for games

97
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,839
一般来说 没有一台服务器能独立应付 但现在
often no one server can deal with it alone, but now

98
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,002
可以将其分配到多个游戏服务器上
you split them up between multiple game servers

99
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,543
玩家从一个区域切换到另一个区域时
and when the players transition from one region to another

100
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:41,863
这一切都非常无缝
it is so seamless

101
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,964
他们甚至没有察觉到其中的奥妙
they don't even notice the trick.

102
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,285
试想一下
Just think about that.

103
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:50,028
哎呀 我得开始省点咖啡钱来买它了
Goodness, so I better start cutting down on the coffee budget to buy it.

104
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:52,089
我可是说的不是BMW哦
I mean, not the BMW

105
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,692
而是能顺利运行这个的新的电脑
but a new PC that can run this.

106
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:57,654
星巴克 真是消耗PC预算的罪魁祸首
Starbucks, the destroyer of PC budgets.

107
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:58,514
走开吧
Be gone.

108
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,134
或者说不了
Or not.

109
00:04:59,134 --> 00:04:59,754
我也不知道啊
I don't know.

110
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,456
我可不是美国人
I am not from America.

111
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:03,418
那么如果还是不够
And if we still don't have enough

112
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,860
至少我可以在这儿用租来的便宜Lambda GPU做一个
at least I can make one here with a cheap, rented Lambda GPU

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,502
通过Text2Image
through Text2Image.

114
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,103
哈 赢了！
Ha, checkmate.

115
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,125
现在 你看 哇
And now, look, Ooh

116
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,125
你还没见过真正的东西呢
you haven't seen anything yet.

117
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,689
他们居然还有一份公开的路线图 真是不可思议！
They also have a public roadmap, which is, wow

118
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,552
此时此刻 正在酝酿着许多新事物
an insane amount of things are brewing right as we speak.

119
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:23,692
你看看这！
Just look at that.

120
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:25,555
天哪 纸堆成山！
Holy mother of papers.

121
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:29,017
我最喜欢的三项功能是学习代理
Three of my favorites coming up are learning agents,

122
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:31,740
超赞的效果 以及更好的昼夜变化
yummy, better day and night sequences,

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,360
还有这一项
and then this.

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
哎呀！
Oh my.

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,622
再说一次 大部分功能对我们这些同道是免费的
And once again, all this is free for most of us Fellow Scholars.

126
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,642
这一刻真是太美好了！
What a time to be alive!

127
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,483
如果你受到启发
And if you feel inspired

128
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:48,605
如果你想在NVIDIA GPU上尝试一些实验 推荐你使用Lambda
and you wish to run your own experiments on NVIDIA GPUs, check out Lambda.

129
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:52,726
Lambda是一个专为大型人工智能项目设计的云服务
Lambda is a cloud service for large-scale AI projects

130
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,723
这真的是我最喜欢的服务
and it is my absolute favorite.

131
00:05:55,723 --> 00:06:00,327
