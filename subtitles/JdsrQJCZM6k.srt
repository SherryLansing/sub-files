1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,032
好吧 我个人经历过的最独特的驾驶体验之一
Alright so one of the most unique motoring experiences I've ever had

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:04,933
个人
personally

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:05,814
是我曾经的
was back

4
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,456
日常开特斯拉的时候
when I was daily driving a Tesla I got to drive

5
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:13,199
我试驾了2008年的特斯拉跑车
and borrow the original the Tesla Roadster from 2008

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,762
真正感受到了电动跑车的起点
and got to really feel the beginning

7
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:22,246
体会到了电动跑车本该有的感觉
and the experience of what original electric sports car was supposed to be

8
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:26,550
然后 自那之后的变化触手可及
and then obviously see the evolution that happened since then.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,490
现在我日常开的是911
Now you know I'm daily driving a 911

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,787
我问的一个问题是
and The question I may have had is

11
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:34,608
类似的体验又会是什么样的呢？
what would an equivalent throwback experience be?

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,330
而这辆车 其实并没有看上去那么简单
And this one, it's actually not exactly what it looks like

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,430
你们可能在想 哎呀
because you're probably thinking, oh

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,592
你是说 你要开一辆手动的经典涡轮车吗？
you're going to drive a manual OG turbo?

15
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,892
那可是辆驾驶起来让人疯狂的车呀！
That's a crazy car to drive.

16
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:45,213
不 不是的
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,974
这辆车 实际上是电动的
This one, this one's electric.

18
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:48,954
最近几天
So for the past couple of days

19
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:52,996
迈尔斯和我最近开这辆车 真的是一种享受
Miles and I have had a real treat driving around this thing.

20
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,677
这是款经过改装的964款保时捷911
This is a sort of remodeled 964 generation Porsche 911.

21
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,817
这辆车是由Sacrilege Motors公司完全改装成电动的
to be fully electric by a company called Sacrilege Motors

22
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,037
名字取得也是很有意思
probably appropriately named

23
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,521
因为很多人看到这一点时
because there's plenty of people who see this

24
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:11,146
看到电动汽车时觉得有些不妥
and see electric and that feels sacrilegious

25
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,527
但你可以看到评论
but then you see the reviews

26
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,370
以及人们对开这辆车的看法
and what people have thought about driving this thing

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,662
而似乎他们的表现非常出色
and Seems like they've done an incredible job.

28
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:18,543
所以我想去看看
So I just wanted to check it out

29
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:20,483
看看这车开起来怎么样
and see how this actually drove.

30
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:26,686
结果它是手动原始驾驶感与新动力系统的完美结合
And it turns out it's an incredible combination of the manual original feel

31
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,256

with this obviously new powertrain being

32
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,778
我敢说 这比原版更好
Well, I'll say it, better than the original.

33
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:34,438
如果你回去看看那段最初的
Now, if you go back and watch that original

34
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,441
2008年特斯拉跑车的视频
Living with the 2008 Tesla Roadster video,

35
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,980
你会看到
you'll see, I mean

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,683
这让人感受到一种浓厚的怀旧气息
it's quite a throwback from the Teslas of today.

37
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,384
屏幕小了许多
The screens are much smaller

38
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,925
汽车也小了许多
the car is much smaller

39
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,046
电池小了许多
the battery is much smaller

40
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,867
而且所有的东西都比较落后
and everything is just further behind.

41
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:50,349
它更偏向于模拟 但并不完全是
It's more analog, but not completely.

42
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:53,590
这一代车型最早出现在80年代
This generation car first came out in the 80s.

43
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,171
这是1989年的一款车型
It's a 1989 model.

44
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:57,798
所以这里没有任何屏幕
And so there were no screens.

45
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,000
这更像是一种重温往昔的感觉
This is even more of a throwback.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,941
你可能会觉得和它一起生活可真疯狂
And so you might think living with it would be crazy.

47
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,222
然后把这些稀有的车开回来
And then taking one of these rare cars

48
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:08,125
而把它改造成电动车
and going through the work of turning it into an electric car is just

49
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,206
简直是一个疯狂的想法
a crazy idea.

50
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,608
不过 经过一段时间的使用
But after I've lived with it now

51
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,308
现在我真的懂人们为什么这么做了
I actually get why people do it.

52
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:17,072
在我的经历中 有些惊喜
And there may be some surprises in my experience

53
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:17,931
我现在就和大家分享
that I'll share with you now.

54
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,393
那我们就直接开始吧！
So let's just jump right in.

55
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:21,703
首先 这辆车太美了！
So first of all, gorgeous car.

56
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,264
我可能有偏见 因为我选择了
I might be biased because I'm obviously

57
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,064
这款受其启发的车
I chose a car that's inspired heavily by this

58
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,786
而且我还有一辆黑色的
and I actually have a black one too

59
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,507
但你可以看到这是宽体车型
but you can see this is the wide body one

60
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:34,467
而且它也是一辆敞篷车
and it's a convertible as well so cabriolet if you want to call it that

61
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,288
有个有趣的点：
and the thing to note here that's kind of interesting

62
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,269
这里有很多部件
is there's a lot of parts here

63
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,750
这些部件来自原版保时捷
that are shared from the original Porsche parts

64
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,571
还有很多新部件 比如这些轮子
but also a lot of new parts like you can see these wheels here

65
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:47,492
你可以看到这些新款的Brembo刹车几乎塞不进车轮下面
you also see these new Brembo brakes that barely fit underneath the wheels

66
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:50,554
而且他们还装上了Pilot Sport轮胎
and but they get in there pilot sport tires

67
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:53,597
几乎塞不进护翼的轮胎
that barely fit under the fenders

68
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,717
而且后面的轮胎也非常宽大
and these are some big wide tires back here too

69
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,562
这些是295宽、18英寸的轮圈
matter of fact what can i see these are 295 section 18 inch rims

70
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:03,284
后面的轮胎相当有劲
these are some juicy tires back here

71
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,507
尤其是考虑到这辆车的动力
for the amount of power this thing puts out

72
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,209
马力为500 扭矩为500牛米
which is 500 horsepower and 500 newton meters

73
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,776
现在 它已经是电动车了！
Now, it's electric

74
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,377
如今许多汽车的电池就安装在
so a lot of the cars built today have the batteries in

75
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,839
就像小滑板一样
like this little skateboard

76
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,319
车底下
underneath the car.

77
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,081
那这个车的电池在哪里呢？
But where's the battery in here?

78
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,322
其实这里有两个电池
There's actually two.

79
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,842
前面有一个大电池
Big one in the front

80
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,503
后面还有一个大电池
and big one in the back.

81
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,019
所以如果有机会的话
so on the off chance

82
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,460
你是在进行公路旅行
that you're doing a road trip

83
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,621
或者说 这辆车有一点前备箱空间
or something in this car you do have a little bit of front trunk space

84
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:44,442
但是不多
not a huge amount

85
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:49,824
但可以放下一个适配器 或者一个登机箱大小的包
but enough for an adapter maybe a bag a carry-on size bag or so

86
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,966
而那半块电池就藏在地毯下面
but that's half the battery right there below that carpeting

87
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,467
还有可调的减震器
also your adjustable dampers

88
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,709
我想那是你的挡风玻璃刮水器液
and i i think that's uh your windshield wiper fluid so there's

89
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:10,806
如此一来 重量的一半就在这里 后面是这个标志性的鸭尾
where half the weight goes So behind this iconic ducktail

90
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:14,748
原发电厂的位置有另一半电池
where the old power plant used to be there's the other half of the battery

91
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,250
当然 还有减震器
and of course your dampers as well

92
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,892
但那确实很重
but that is a whole bunch of weight

93
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,814
你可以看到 重量分布均匀
so now you can see it's kind of evenly distributed

94
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:21,495
这里没有额外储存空间
there's no more storage in here

95
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,028
前面和后面各有一半电池
but there's half the battery in the front half the battery in the back

96
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:30,793
这样的话 总共能让你行驶大约200英里
And in total, that's going to get you around 200 miles of range

97
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,795
如果正常驾驶 这辆车一次充电能行驶
on a single charge if you drive it like normal

98
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,778
这还挺令人印象深刻的
which is actually kind of impressive

99
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,519
因为这车真的很小
because of how small this car really is.

100
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,762
毕竟 这车没什么空间放电池
I mean, you don't expect a whole bunch of space to put battery in.

101
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,204
电池不在地板上
But since the battery is not on the floor

102
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,565
所以驾驶位置
that means the driving position

103
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:46,728
而且内饰比原版更接近了
and all this interior is closer than ever to the original.

104
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:47,990
这些是新座位
These are new seats.

105
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,610
当然
But then, of course

106
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,471
我进来的时候
when I get in here

107
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,565
你会看到许多原版保时捷 我记得这一点
you're going to see a whole bunch original Porsche so I remember

108
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:58,348
当我制作电动大众巴士时
when I made that video on the refreshed Volkswagen bus the electric one

109
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,089
ID Buzz 收到了很多
the ID buzz there was a lot

110
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,651
评论说这挺酷的
of comments that were like this is kind of cool

111
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,112
大概是这样
I guess

112
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:06,175
但我希望他们能还原那个旧的复古设计
but I wish they just took the exact old retro design

113
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,016
然后把它改成电动版
and they just made that one electric

114
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,658
而我现在完全明白了
and I totally get it now

115
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,261
因为这车基本上就是这样
because that's basically what this car is

116
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:17,425
我四周都是模拟部件 根本看不到屏幕
I am surrounded by analog parts not a single screen in sight

117
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:22,639
其实他们给我装了一个小屏幕 用于车载娱乐
well actually they've given me a little tiny screen here for car play

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,980
但这几乎算不上屏幕
and it barely counts as a screen

119
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,100
因为这个是额外加上去的
because this is added extra

120
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,821
但开车时 你只需专注于这个方向盘
but when you're driving you're focused here on this wheel

121
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,141
还有这精致的内饰
and on this beautiful interior

122
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,903
现在的仪表基本上就是这些 你之前看到的那个钥匙
which is basically just your gauges now you saw that key from before

123
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:40,363
这就是启动车的方法 把钥匙插进去 转一转
this is the way to turn the car on stick the key right in there turn it

124
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:45,466
你会看到这些仪表转动 显示也都更新了
and you see these gauges spin up so the gauges are of course updated

125
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,526
以适应这辆车的电动特性
a bit to work with the electric nature of this car

126
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,392
所以它在显示我的电池电量
so it's telling me my battery level

127
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,452
它还会告知我
It's also going to tell me

128
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,733
我现在的驾驶模式
which drive mode I'm in

129
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,853
我正在使用多少电力
how much power I'm using.

130
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,036
音效不错
Great sound.

131
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,418
能看到我还有多少续航
You can see how much range I have left.

132
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,019
我现在在舒适模式
I'm in chill mode right now.

133
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,019
那里显示的是我的速度
And over there is my speed.

134
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,521
这是一个更新的仪表盘 但依然非常传统
So this is an updated gauge cluster, but very much analog.

135
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,762
这里是你的驻车制动
You've got your parking brake down here.

136
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:18,658
我现在把脚放在刹车上 准备倒车、行驶和空档
This is, I'll put foot on the brake, reverse, drive, neutral.

137
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:22,560
而且他们增加了一个带电源的MagSafe充电器
And they've actually added a MagSafe puck

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,221
可以给你的MagSafe设备充电
with power just to charge your MagSafe devices.

139
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,163
如果你想用CarPlay
So if you do want CarPlay

140
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,803
想把你的iPhone放在那儿的话
if you want to put your iPhone there

141
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,524
这个小细节加得不错
that is a nice little touch that they've added.

142
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:36,586
虽然整辆车的其它部分都很复古
Even though the entire rest of this car is super retro

143
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:40,392
但是你可以在它该放的位置给你的新手机充电
you can have your brand new phone charging right there where it belongs.

144
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:40,572
但是
but

145
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,012
对
yeah

146
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:44,615
哇！这里发生的每一件小事都让人感到无比怀旧
oh my god every single little thing happening here is such a throwback

147
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:48,036
空调这里的这些缺口用于冷却
the air conditioning these notches here for cooling

148
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,778
以及空气流出的地方用于加热
and heating for where the air comes out

149
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,178
显然 所有通风口都是手动的 我们不需要屏幕
obviously all manual vents we're not doing any screens

150
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,620
针对那种情况
for that type of stuff

151
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,880
当然 这里就是你的锁
and of course you have your lock here

152
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,882
打开车门的方式就是这个小玩意儿
and the way you open the door is just this little thing right here

153
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:02,031
这真酷 我超喜欢！
this is sick I'm loving it.

154
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,432
这边还有几个按钮
Now there's a couple other buttons over here

155
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,973
你应该知道的
that you do want to know about,

156
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:08,334
尤其是这个带感叹号的按钮
specifically this one with an exclamation point on it

157
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,716
可以将汽车从休闲模式切换到
which switches the car from chill mode

158
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,456
等一下 上面写着 '开我'
hold on it says crank me

159
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:20,759
因为它让我彻底切换到运动模式 而不是舒适模式
because it wants me to fully turn it on, from chill mode to sport mode.

160
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,858
而这些车的一个特点就是非常个性化
And The thing about these cars is they are so kind of custom

161
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,199
而且每一台都是量身打造的
and like one-off built that you know

162
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,800
舒适模式的能量回收率较高 大约达到65%
there is chill mode which is more regen 65% regen

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,781
这模式提供的动力约为三分之二到四分之三
and a you know two-thirds three-quarters of the power

164
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,521
但他们能够进行个性化设置
but they can tailor it

165
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,242
在为你定制汽车时
when they build you the car to be exactly the way you want

166
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,223
运动模式的能量回收较低
sport mode has less regen

167
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:45,363
能量回收接近20%
closer to 20% regen

168
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:49,343
但可提供最大动力 所有功能都可定制
but is giving you all of the power again all that can be customized

169
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,845
坐在这样的车里 真让我觉得不可思议
but it's just crazy to me to sit in a car like this

170
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:55,124
想起以前的车那么小
and knowing that cars used to be so small

171
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,024
你只需伸手就能碰到
that you could reach over

172
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,886
甚至不用完全伸直手臂 就能碰到另一侧
and just Touch the other side without fully extending your arm

173
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,528
以前的车小得多、薄得多
cars used to be so much smaller

174
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:05,069
这车居然没有安全气囊
so much thinner There's no airbag in this car

175
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,990
不过 挡风玻璃刮水器在这里依然存在
but you've got your windshield wipers here.

176
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,891
转向灯也在这儿
You've got your blinkers over here

177
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:12,274
一切还是那么熟悉
Things are all still in the familiar places

178
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,855
这一切让我感到无比怀旧
but it's just such a throwback.

179
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:14,654
真是太棒了！
It's so sick.

180
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:20,997
这是一种独特的体验 后座也配备了
This is This is a one-of-a-kind Experience you also have your back seats.

181
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:21,798
别忘了这些哦
Don't forget about those

182
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,372
我的车也有 但几乎没法用
and My car has the same thing, barely usable.

183
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:25,533
后面最好不要坐成年人
You don't want an adult back there

184
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,535
不过如果你愿意也是可以的
but you could do it if you want to.

185
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,718
不过我先把驾驶体验交给Miles
But I'm going to pass it to Miles for the driving experience

186
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,178
因为内饰我已经给你看过了
because I've shown you the interior.

187
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,160
我已经给你介绍了基本信息
I've shown you the basics.

188
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,682
你可以开200英里 所以Miles
You get 200 miles of driving, so Miles

189
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,783
开起来感觉怎么样？
what's it like to drive?

190
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,306
这辆车的品牌叫做Sacrilege Motors
The brand of this car is Sacrilege Motors

191
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:44,789
因为这个想法对于很多老派的保时捷爱好者来说
because the idea to a lot of OG Porsche enthusiasts

192
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,032
有人竟然会把这样的车
that someone would take a car like this

193
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:51,514
而把电动机装进去 简直太疯狂了 对吧？
and put electric motors inside is kind of crazy, right?

194
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,558
我觉得汽车界存在一个大问题
And I think there's this big problem with the car community

195
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:57,360
很多人觉得它只能是其中一种
where people think it just has to be one

196
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,604
或者另一种 这在某些车辆中尤为明显
or the other for certain types of vehicles.

197
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:04,609
人们对此感到不满 觉得新法拉利超级跑车怎么能用V6而不是V12呢？
People are upset that the new Ferrari hypercar has a V6 instead of a V12.

198
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:05,889
但如果你能买得起那辆车
But if you can afford that car

199
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,433
那又有什么理由不去拥有其他12辆V12的车呢？
what's stopping you from owning 12 other cars with a V12?

200
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,916
你可以以同样的角度看待这辆车
You should look at this car the same way.

201
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,356
如果你有将近80万美元的预算
If you have nearly $800,000

202
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:17,719
或者你还有更多预算可以购买这样的车
or more to spend on a car like this

203
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:21,442
那有什么理由不把相同的钱
what's also stopping you from spending the equivalent money

204
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:24,842
花在经典的内燃机保时捷911上呢？
on a classic ICE Porsche 911?

205
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:25,964
综合以上这些考虑
And so with all that in mind

206
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:26,764
我觉得这是非常重要的
I think it's important

207
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:30,086
不要把这辆车和内燃机911放在一起比较
that we don't try to compare this to an ICE 911

208
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,947
因为如果你能负担得起这辆车
because if you can afford this car

209
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,328
你也可以考虑直接去买一辆内燃机964
you can also just get an internal combustion engine 964.

210
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,971
我想说的是 这辆车有
But what I will say... is that what they've done an amazing job at

211
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,293
很多了不起之处
with this car is

212
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:44,255
确保唯一与911不一样的就是
making sure the only thing that doesn't feel like a 911

213
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:48,078
就是你车上用的是电动驱动
is the fact that you have electric motors for the drivetrain.

214
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,681
开这辆车的其他每一方面
Literally every other aspect of driving this car

215
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:54,383
甚至连那种气味
even down to the smells

216
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:58,927
都能让你感受到经典保时捷911的魅力
is definitely what you would experience with a classic Porsche 911.

217
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:04,948
转向手感很好 有重量感 连接性强 反馈非常灵敏
The steering field is nice, weighted, connected, super communicative.

218
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,190
需要一点力气才能启动
takes a bit of elbow work to get it going

219
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,471
就像90和80年代的经典保时捷那样
just like a classic Porsche from the 90s, 80s.

220
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,052
显然 它的底盘非常低
It's obviously super low to the ground.

221
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,732
车身非常硬挺
It's very stiff

222
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:17,413
由于配备了可调三向避震器
because of those three-way adjustable coilovers

223
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,235
稍后我们会详细讨论
that we'll talk about a little bit later.

224
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,535
还有 这辆车非常轻盈
And then the lightness.

225
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:26,278
这辆车的重量略超过3000磅
This car only weighs just barely over 3,000 pounds

226
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,001
这使得它比大多数
which makes this lighter than most

227
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,763
汽油车都轻
gas powered cars currently on sale today.

228
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:37,543
动力系统依旧保持传统911的4060重量分布
We also still have the 4060 weight distribution of a traditional 911.

229
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:41,485
所以无论是重量转移、整体平衡还是操控性
So weight transfer, general balance and handling

230
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:44,485
都与原版车不相上下
it's all on par with the original car.

231
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,485
不过 当然
But then of course

232
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:52,206
它的马力达到500马力 扭矩超过500牛米
you've got 500 horsepower, just a little over 500 Newton meters of torque.

233
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,586
我将在这里把数据换算成磅英尺
I'll put the conversion here to pound feet.

234
00:10:55,908 --> 00:11:01,610
这辆车重3000磅 马力500 还是后驱
And so 3000 pounds, 500 horsepower and rear-wheel drive only.

235
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,015
这车加速很快
This thing is quick

236
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:07,937
说实话 有时候驾驶起来让人有点紧张
and it's quite frankly a little scary at times

237
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:09,658
就因为它太小了
just because of how small it is.

238
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:13,101
确实有种经典老车的感觉
It certainly has that OG car feel

239
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,663
就像我们今年在频道中试过的其他车
just like other cars we've had on the channel this year,

240
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,484
比如大众ID Buzz
like the Volkswagen ID Buzz.

241
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,804
像这样的老车真的会让你觉得
Older cars like that really make you feel like,

242
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,267
是的 如果你出错
yeah, if you screw up in this thing

243
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,868
几乎没什么能救你
there's not a lot that's going to save you.

244
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,969
不过 这就是驾驶这种车的乐趣之一
But that's a part of the fun with cars like these,

245
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:31,576
这些老式保时捷 专为运动设计的跑车
these older Porsches, these older purpose-built sports cars.

246
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:34,116
某种程度上 缺乏安全性
the lack of safety in a sense

247
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:37,118
反而增加了体验的刺激感
is almost what adds to the thrill of the experience

248
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:39,898
这辆车完全没有驾驶辅助
and so in this car there are zero nannies

249
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,038
连牵引力控制系统都没有
you have no traction control system

250
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,340
你只需把方向盘向左转
so you turn the wheel to the left

251
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,960
猛踩油门
and floor it

252
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,441
这辆车立刻侧滑 悬挂系统很有趣,
and you are going sideways the suspension on this car is actually

253
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,541
确实很有意思
really interesting

254
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:54,403
首先 你会注意到 它的悬挂非常硬
firstly i'm sure you've noticed in this footage that it is pretty stiff uh

255
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,883
车身也很低
it sits very low

256
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,124
所以你会感受到很多路面的颠簸
and so you're gonna feel a lot of those bumps

257
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:01,625
不过 这要看个人的需求和习惯 能否接受
but It's certainly livable depending on who you are, I guess

258
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,907
以及你居住的区域
and the area you live in.

259
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:04,047
我住在新泽西
I live in New Jersey

260
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:08,509
因此 在这里的乘坐舒适性可能不如
so obviously ride comfort is going to always not be the best

261
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,811
其他地方
compared to other places.

262
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:10,931
不过 它是可调的
But it is adjustable

263
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,813
这是因为它们是三段式可调避震器
and that's because these are three-way adjustable coilovers

264
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,274
Penske Racing制造的
made by Penske Racing.

265
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,956
他们以为超级跑车制造悬挂系统而闻名
And they're known for making setups for, like, you know, supercars,

266
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,158
和运动跑车
sports cars.

267
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,820
所以这个悬挂系统与一些地方的搭配非常相似
And so what this setup is is very similar to something that you'd get in,

268
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,921
比如说一辆GT3 RS
like, a GT3 RS, for example.

269
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,485
这个配置的一个亮点就是配备了远程储液器
One of the killer parts of this setup is having remote reservoirs

270
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:33,849
您可以打开后备厢看到这些储液器
that you can see by opening the rear hatch of the car.

271
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,772
这些远程储液器
And so you have these remote reservoirs

272
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:39,676
与车辆底部的主液箱相连
that are connected to the primary fluid tank

273
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,460
液体通过液压管在车底
underneath the car via these hydraulic lines

274
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,662
循环流动
that are feeding fluid back and forth.

275
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,342
这样做的好处之一就是维护更加方便
and so the benefits you're getting is firstly maintenance

276
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:50,965
只需打开后备厢 您就能轻松访问这些储液器
it's easier to access those reservoirs by just popping over the rear hatch

277
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,785
您只需打开后备厢
but then secondly you're getting easy adjustability

278
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,547
就能轻松调节
by just opening the rear hatch

279
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:58,288
再调节与油箱连接的旋钮
and adjusting the knobs connected to the reservoir

280
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:01,730
这让您能够轻松调整驾驶体验
which makes it super easy to tailor your driving experience

281
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,110
适应不同的场景
to whatever scenario you're in

282
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,413
这并不是专为赛道高性能驾驶
this is not necessarily designed to be a super high performance

283
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,312
而设计的车
track vehicle

284
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,937
不过 由于这种配置
but because of this setup

285
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,778
还有车的重量和动力
and the weight and the power

286
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:16,259
您绝对可以把这辆车带去赛道试驾
you certainly could take this to a track day

287
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,039
而且可能会让很多人大吃一惊
and probably embarrass a lot of folks.

288
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,120
整体上 这款车的乘坐舒适性
And so overall, you're working with ride comfort

289
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,341
比
that's not only better than

290
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,782
原版964车型提供的舒适性
what you would get from an original 964,

291
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,663
而且更具可调性 性能也更卓越
but more adjustable and more capable as well.

292
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:30,104
这辆车的刹车系统非常优秀
You're also working with a very healthy brake setup in this car.

293
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:34,934
前部配备六活塞卡钳 后部配备四活塞卡钳
You've got six piston calipers up front, four piston calipers in the rear,

294
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:38,297
环绕的Brembo刹车盘
big steel Brembo rotors all around.

295
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:41,018
这样的配置在许多车辆中是常见的
And so a setup like that is what you'd find on a lot of

296
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:44,960
在过去10年中的高端超级跑车中常见
like high-end supercars from like the past 10 years or so.

297
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,660
不过 刹车的调节非常出色
But the braking modulation is also really nice.

298
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,101
它并不像很多运动汽车那样敏感
It's not super grabby

299
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:52,143
不会像许多运动汽车那样刺耳
and stabby like a lot of sports cars are known to be.

300
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,544
刹车过程非常平滑而渐进
It's very smooth and gradual

301
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:58,366
这让日常驾驶变得更加轻松
which makes it a lot easier to live with as a daily driver

302
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,869
如果你有这样的想法
if that's something you wanted to attempt to do.

303
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,230
正如我一开始提到的
So like I mentioned at the beginning

304
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,655
我认为把这个和同年代的911进行比较没有什么意义
I don't think it makes sense to try to compare this as an alternative

305
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,179
与这个时代的NI同款911相比
to the equivalent 911 from this era.

306
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,240
不过 就这一点而言
But even with that in mind

307
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,067
我觉得我们应该将乐趣与这个时代的911进行对比
I do think we should evaluate the fun factor versus a 911 of this era

308
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:21,629
不是由电动机和电池驱动的
not powered by electric motors and a battery.

309
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,291
我觉得这真得看个人的情况
I think it really depends on who you are.

310
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,913
对某些人来说 没有那种声音就不会有
For some people, not having that noise is just not going to do

311
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:27,854
任何感觉
anything for you,

312
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:32,398
无论这车看起来有多令人畏惧或多强大
no matter how scary and how capable the car is overall.

313
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:37,701
在我看来 我很想为某人买这个
To me, this is something I think I would love to buy for someone

314
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,962
想要驾驶911的感觉的人
who wants the feeling of driving a 911

315
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:46,787
又不想承担维护责任
without having to deal with all of the maintenance responsibilities

316
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:51,004
维护这一代911带来的麻烦
that come with maintaining a 911 from this era.

317
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,086
拥有这样一辆车时
When getting a car like this

318
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,684
你就不用担心那些麻烦了
you're not going to have to deal with that sort of stuff.

319
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:58,607
我觉得学习这些也是一项有趣的挑战
And I think it's also an interesting challenge to try to learn

320
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,610
理解这种瞬时动力输出的汽车
and understand a car with this type of instantaneous power delivery

321
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,333
没有电子牵引力控制辅助
without any of the electronic traction control assists

322
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,955
和其他复杂的系统
and all that fun stuff.

323
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,135
这和学习手动变速的993涡轮增压车
It's certainly different

324
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:14,019
确实是不同的
than learning to understand a manual transmission 993 turbo

325
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,743
你需要合理地控制换挡时机和油门
where you have to properly time shifts and throttle input with, you know

326
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:23,817
如果你驾驶的是涡轮增压的911 就要注意涡轮增压带来的动力
the boost of the turbos if you have a turbocharged 911, that sort of stuff.

327
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,398
这绝对是种全新的体验
It's certainly an entirely different experience

328
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:30,639
无法将其与
one that you can't just compare directly to

329
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,640
内燃机驱动的911进行简单比较
an internal combustion engine powered 911.

330
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,844
开这样一辆车 几乎不可能不感到快乐
I think it's pretty hard to not have fun in a car like this

331
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:43,267
即使你更喜欢那种8000转的高转速体验
even if you would prefer having, you know, an 8,000 RPM, high revving,

332
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:46,288
手动变速箱的驾驶乐趣
you know, manual transmission experience.

333
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,671
这并不能取代那种乐趣
This is not a replacement for that

334
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,653
如果你的预算允许
but if you have a budget that allows for it

335
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,934
我觉得这是个很不错的选择
I think it's a pretty cool addition.

336
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,476
我想很多人可能会
It's something that I think a lot of people are going to be

337
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,879
持保留态度
naturally very skeptical about

338
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,160
不过我觉得这也是应该的
but I think it's only right

339
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,984
所以在排除之前 试试也是值得的
that you give it a try before ruling it out.

340
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:05,184
如果你有这些东西
When you have all these things

341
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,525
有保时捷的媒体中心
when you have the Porsche media center

342
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,368
能体验到保时捷的驾驶感
you have the Porsche steering feel

343
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,009
能闻到保时捷的那种气味
you have the Porsche smell

344
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,650
就像我吉姆叔叔那些老保时捷的味道
it smells like a lot of my Uncle Jim's old Porsches.

345
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,912
这真是太疯狂了
It's actually crazy.

346
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:18,153
考虑到这一切的时候
When you put all that into consideration

347
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,316
你就会明白为什么价格会这么高
you can understand how you can get to an extremely high price point

348
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,116
因为这些都是手工制作的车
because these are hand-built machines.

349
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:28,118
这些可不是特斯拉Model 3那样的
These are not Tesla Model 3s where, you know

350
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,198
这里的缝隙就很奇怪
you'll see weird gaps here

351
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,601
还有那些让人感到古怪的不一致
and there and weird quirky inconsistencies.

352
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:40,245
这确实有种真正的德国车的感觉
This has that real OG German car feel, which is, you know

353
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,125
对于一些人来说 这种感觉是无法用价格来衡量的
it's hard to put a price on that for some people.

354
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,659
我想我真的爱上这个车了
I think I love this thing.

355
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:56,480
我觉得我已经爱上这款车了
I think I love this thing.

356
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,163
这可能是我在这里测试过的最喜欢的车
This might be my favorite car that we've actually gotten to test here.

357
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,927
这不仅仅是车 更是一种体验
And it's part the car, part the experience.

358
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:08,009
我又想到了2008年特斯拉跑车的视频
Again, I keep throwing back to that 2008 Tesla Roadster video

359
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,093
自从第一款特斯拉跑车以来
how far the technology has come since the original Tesla Roadster,

360
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,314
电池的密度
the battery density

361
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,315
你能获得多远的续航
how much range you get

362
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,355
充电速度快得惊人
how fast they charge.

363
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:18,013
我还没来得及给你看呢
I didn't even show you.

364
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,958
在结束前 我给你看看最后一件事
I should show you one last thing before I wrap this up.

365
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,820
这个充电方式其实挺简单的
How you charge this is actually kind of really intuitive.

366
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,603
你只需抓住它往外拉
You just grab this and pull.

367
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,686
然后这个就打开了
And this opens.

368
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,087
你的充电口就在这里
And there's your charge port right here.

369
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,169
CCS
CCS.

370
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:32,230
直接把它放进去就行
Pop it right in there.

371
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,333
就像你想的那样 这实际上就像一个油箱
Like you would expect that to be a sort of a gas tank

372
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,843
但他们考虑得非常周全
but they've thought of everything.

373
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,085
不过我非常喜欢这个项目
But I love this project

374
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:46,672
因为这是一辆显然来自80年代的经典老车
because it's just such an obviously original, OG-looking car from the 80s,

375
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,633
那经典的外形
the classic shape.

376
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,256
我觉得没有人会对这个911的造型不喜欢
I don't think anyone's ever not liked the shape of this 911

377
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:53,939
而它恰好有我所熟悉的
but then it just has what I'm familiar with

378
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,280
那就是我熟悉的电动驾驶体验
which is the electric driving experience

379
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,170
而且这方面做得非常出色
and kind of does it really well.

380
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,030
这是一辆极具乐趣的车
This is an ultimate fun car.

381
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,891
我真心喜欢它
I love it.

382
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,612
如果你想了解 可以在下方找到链接
I'll leave a link below if you want to check them out.

383
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,212
看这个视频的人不会去买这样的车
Probably nobody who actually watches this is going to go buy one of these

384
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,813
但这绝对是最牛逼的体验之一
but it's one of the sickest things ever

385
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,173
我很高兴能体验到这个
and I'm glad I got to experience it.

386
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,233
希望能再体验一次
Hopefully I get to try this again.

387
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:14,055
好的 谢谢大家的观看！
All right, thanks for watching.

388
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,115
下次见！
Catch you in the next one.

389
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:15,296
保持平安！
Peace.
