1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:01,950
我真不敢相信！
I can't believe this.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,251
大家请拿稳你们的资料！
Now hold on to your papers, fellow scholars

3
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:08,913
因为这个人工智能可以分析《我的世界》的游戏玩法
because this AI is able to look at gameplay of Minecraft

4
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:10,954
并理解游戏的运作方式
and learn how the game works

5
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:12,955
然后一切就变得疯狂了
and then it gets crazy.

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,617
接着 它会为你重现这个游戏
After that, it recreates the game for you

7
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:18,738
你可以马上实时体验这款游戏
that you can play in real time right now

8
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:20,959
通过视频下方的链接
through the link in the video description.

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:21,980
我必须说
I got to say

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,861
运行得简直如梦似幻
it runs like a dream.

11
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:26,663
这好坏参半
In a good way, and in a bad way too.

12
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:28,424
我真不敢相信这竟是真的
I really can't believe this

13
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:32,787
因为我们刚才还谈论过谷歌和《毁灭战士》的项目
because we just talked about Google's project on doing this with Doom,

14
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:36,089
而仅仅过了几天 我们就见到了这个
and just a few days later, here we are.

15
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:38,891
这些真的很惊人 因为在这里的表现
And these are really amazing, because here

16
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:43,314
我们不仅仅是给它输入文本来生成图像或视频
we don't just give it a text prompt to generate an image or video

17
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:49,878
而是可以直接用键盘和鼠标与模型实时互动
but we can interact with the model in real time using a keyboard and mouse.

18
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:56,222
所以 这意味着我们可以走动、探索、跳跃 甚至打破方块
So, yes, that means we can walk around, explore, jump, and hit blocks.

19
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,382
这非常不错！
That is good.

20
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,463
但更棒的部分来了！
But here comes the better part.

21
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:05,066
你甚至可以打开物品栏 放置物品、铲子等
You can even open up your inventory, place objects, shovel, and more.

22
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,602
把火把放到墙上 它就亮起了
And when placing a torch on the wall, it lights up.

23
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,302
它对此也能理解
it understands that too

24
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,105
而当你吃东西的时候
and when you eat some food

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,387
它会把这东西从你的库存中拿掉
it kind of removes it from your stockpile

26
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:19,430
如果你能从这两个像素中看出来的话
if you can make it out from the two pixels that we see here.

27
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,311
现在要说的是糟糕的部分
Now comes the bad part.

28
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,833
欢迎收看《两分钟论文》
Dear Fellow Scholars, this is

29
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,495
我是卡罗利·佐尔奈-费赫尔博士
Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.

30
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,016
那么 问题出在哪里呢？
Okay, so what's bad?

31
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:31,439
嗯 它的像素非常粗糙 分辨率也极低
Well, it is highly pixelated and super low resolution.

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,040
而且 不止如此
But Not only that

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,340
画面会变得非常马赛克
things can get so pixelated

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,361
我根本不知道我在看什么
I am not even sure what I am looking at here.

35
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:42,162
这好像是一种动物 可能是一只猪
This is supposed to be some sort of animal, a pig perhaps.

36
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:47,284
而且 它的记忆大约只有几分钟 对吧？
Also, it has memory in the order of a few minutes, right?

37
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:48,123
不太对
Not quite.

38
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:50,964
只持续不到3秒
It is less than 3 seconds.

39
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:53,485
这意味着物体不会保持存在
That means no object permanence.

40
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,846
看开一会儿 再看回去
look away, then look back

41
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:58,549
你会发现自己在一个完全不同的地方
and you are suddenly somewhere else.

42
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,771
所以它的运行效果真是非常顺畅
So it really runs like a dream

43
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,914
因为每秒超过20帧
because they got over 20 frames per second

44
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,977
但它也带有一种梦幻般的效果
but it also has this dreamlike quality

45
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:11,080
几秒前的事情就记不清了
without remembering what just happened a couple seconds ago.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,482
不过 这并不是重点
However, that is not the point.

47
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:17,925
关键是 几年前不可能的事
The point is that something that was not possible a couple years ago

48
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,206
如今竟然变成了现实
is now suddenly possible.

49
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,970
没错 这可能是人工智能历史上的一个重要时刻
Yes, this might be a historic moment in AI

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,853
因为这只是新技术的开始
as this is just the beginning of a new kind of technology.

51
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:31,855
有点像在ChatGPT之前的GPT-2
Kind of like what GPT-2 was before ChatGPT.

52
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:36,960
虽然GPT-2很有趣 但很少有人意识到它的潜力
GPT-2 was interesting, but very few saw the potential in it.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,322
而现在 我们有了ChatGPT
And now we have ChatGPT

54
00:02:39,322 --> 00:02:43,485
它是一个强大的存在 迅速引起了全球的关注
which is an absolute powerhouse that took the world by storm.

55
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,967
现在 这个真是快得惊人
Now, this is incredibly fast.

56
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,188
这里有个有趣的与之前系统的比较
Here is a weird comparison against previous systems.

57
00:02:49,188 --> 00:02:53,510
这个生成一个画面只需不到10秒
This does not need 10 to 20 seconds to create one frame.

58
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,633
这个每秒超过20帧
This does over 20 frames per second.

59
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,833
实在是太令人印象深刻了
Very impressive.

60
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,594
不过 这仍需依赖专有硬件
Now note that this still runs on proprietary hardware.

61
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:05,997
不过 模型参数很适合你们这些优秀的学者们
However, the model weights are available for you brilliant Fellow Scholars

62
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:07,199
进行探索
to tinker with

63
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,479
好消息来啦！
and here come the good news.

64
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,040
截至制作这段视频时
As of the making of this video

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,544
你可以通过视频描述中的链接亲自试试
you can try it out yourself through the link in the description.

66
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,366
而且 这个模型有五亿个参数
Also, this is a small half-billion parameter model

67
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,867
因此 它可能会随着时间的推移而扩展
so it can and likely will be scaled up

68
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,909
以提供更高的分辨率
over time to get higher resolution results.

69
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,751
而且 他们使用的专业硬件
and the specialized hardware they use to run it

70
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:30,233
我之前从未听说过
is something I haven't heard of before

71
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,813
这有可能对英伟达造成一定竞争
that could give a little competition for NVIDIA.

72
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,455
这对消费者总是好事
That is always good for the consumer.

73
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,175
因此 赶快去试试
So, make sure to go ahead

74
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,056
在视频描述里试试看！
and try it in the video description

75
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:41,777
欢迎分享你的想法！
and let me know what you think.

76
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:43,538
你们这些学者试过这个吗？
Have you fellow scholars tried it?

77
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,538
你们觉得效果如何呢？
How did it go?

78
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:46,379
请在评论区告诉我你的想法！
Let me know in the comments below.

79

如果你感到启发
And if you feel inspired

80
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:54,343
想要在英伟达GPU上进行实验的话 不妨看看Lambda
and you wish to run your own experiments on NVIDIA GPUs, check out Lambda.

81
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:58,467
Lambda是一个专为大规模人工智能项目设计的云服务
Lambda is a cloud service for large-scale AI projects

82
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:01,471
这可是我最爱的服务！
and it is my absolute favorite.

83
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:06,074
认真推荐 快去lambdalabs.com/papers试试吧
Seriously, try it out now at lambdalabs.com slash papers

or click the link in the description.

85
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,457
如果你选择使用Lambda服务
If you use Lambda

86
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,442
就可以在强大的硬件上进行自己的实验
you can run your own experiments on super powerful hardware

87
