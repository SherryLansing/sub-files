1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:02,916
我真的很喜欢这些新的Pixel手机
So I really like these new Pixel phones.

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:07,617
今年的新设计显而易见 还有新的规格和功能
New designs this year, obviously, but also new specs, new features,

3
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:11,579
还有一些新问题 当然 还有新的价格
also new issues, but of course, new price tags.

4
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,979
我们真的要深入挖掘一下这些手机
So we really got to jump into the nitty gritty

5
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:16,340
的实际优点
of what's actually good about them.

6
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:49,571
所以 我们期待真正强大的旗舰手机
So we've been hoping for a real complete flagship quality competitor

7
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,332
来自谷歌
from Google

8
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,893
已经有一段时间了
for a while now.

9
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:53,053
一方面
And on one hand

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,214
感觉我们终于迎来了这些手机
it feels like we finally got them.

11
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:55,735
但另一方面
But on the other hand

12
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,117
你们有没有看过谷歌发布这些手机的活动？
did you guys watch the Google event announcing these things?

13
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:02,219
通过发布会能看出公司对产品的真实看法
I feel like you can learn a lot about how a company really feels

14
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,581
关于他们正在展示的产品内容
about the products that they're presenting

15
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,563
通过观看发布活动内容
by just watching the announcement event.

16
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:11,685
而这些更像是软件展示
And these felt like a software showcase

17
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:15,031
只是顺便有了几款手机
that just also happened to have some phones to go with it

18
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,093
我想这也算不上什么奇怪的事
which I guess is not insane

19
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,233
考虑到Nexus和Pixel的历史
when you know the history of Nexus and Pixel

20
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,477
这让我对这些手机产生了反感
but it did the opposite of give me confidence in these phones.

21
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:24,078
不过现在我已经连续用这些手机两周了
But now I've been using these phones for two weeks straight

22
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,662
我觉得我能告诉你这些手机的优缺点
and I actually feel like I can tell you what's good or bad about them.

23
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,870
所以我主要想说的是硬件
So hardware is mostly what I'm talking about

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,632
我觉得这些手机确实像旗舰机 给人好印象
when I say these phones feel like flagships in a good way.

25
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:39,754
容易把它们看成和去年一样
Like it would be easy to dismiss them as almost the same as last year,

26
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:40,855
只是变得方了一点
just squared up.

27
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,238
但还有很多其他的小事情
But there are a lot of other little things too.

28
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:46,319
比如屏幕最大亮度更亮
Like the screens are brighter at their max brightness,

29
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,821
Pixel 9达到2700尼特
2700 nits for the Pixel 9

30
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,723
而9 Pro的亮度则是3000尼特
and 3000 nits for the 9 Pros.

31
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,584
还有四周的边框也很均匀
And then the even bezels all the way around.

32
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,406
这需要更多的思考
That requires some extra consideration,

33
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,227
让OLED面板的边缘包裹
wrapping the edges of the OLED panels

34
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,647
在角落处
under those corners.

35
00:01:56,647 --> 00:02:01,331
所有机型上都有新的超声波指纹识别器
And there's a new ultrasonic fingerprint reader under here on all of them.

36
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,311
最后 它的速度大幅提升
Finally, it's way faster

37
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,433
和可靠性都远超之前差劲的光学识别器
and more reliable than the disappointing optical ones from before

38
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,954
我唯一想要的不过是这件小事
the only thing I wish it's such a small thing

39
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,574
我希望能随时解锁
But I wish I could just unlock at any time

40
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:14,876
现在显示屏完全关闭时 你必须保持
when the display is completely off like currently you have to have the

41
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,256
始终显示状态
always-on display on

42
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:19,217
要么按电源按钮 要么收到通知
or Hit the power button or be getting a notification

43
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:23,103
你只需轻按即可解锁 就像三星手机那样
and then you can unlock with a quick touch but Like on Samsung phones

44
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:26,503
显示屏上的那个点始终是热点
that spot on the display is always a hotspot no matter what.

45
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,185
你只需触摸那里解锁
You can just unlock by touching there.

46
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:31,265
我希望Pixel在黑屏时也能如此
So I kind of wish the Pixel would let me do that from a blank screen too.

47
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:32,765
触觉反馈非常出色
The haptics are really nice again

48
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,786
而且今年按钮的手感很棒
and the buttons are really clicky this year.

49
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,807
当然 硬件的表现也是非常重要的
But then of course the hardware is what's on the inside too.

50
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,228
这就是全新的Tensor G4芯片
So that is the new Tensor G4 chip

51
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,972
还有不少额外的内存
and a bunch of extra RAM.

52
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,776
其实 Tensor G4 的性能并没有比
Now, the Tensor G4 isn't actually that much more powerful

53
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,217
去年的芯片强多少
than last year's chip.

54
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,840
其实 你几乎不会察觉到有什么不同
In fact, you probably won't notice a difference

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,245
对于你在手机上进行的99%的操作来说
for 99% of the stuff you do on the phone.

56
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:59,031
不过 真正重要的是一个全新的NPU 它更强大
But what's actually significant is a new NPU that's way more powerful

57
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,829
专注于AI任务
and dedicated to AI tasks.

58
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,270
而且更多的RAM同样专门用于AI任务
And the way more RAM is also dedicated to AI tasks.

59
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,693
我听说大部分RAM实际上是专门预留给AI相关的任务
I'm told a big portion of the RAM is literally reserved for AI stuff.

60
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:12,533
我很快会讲到这些AI的内容 请放心
So I will get to all that AI stuff in a minute, don't worry.

61
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,735
不过 考虑到我们所处的时代
But just in the world that we're living in,

62
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:18,037
很多主要新智能手机的市场动态在这里
where the meta for a lot of these major new smartphones is,

63
00:03:18,037 --> 00:03:20,657
嗯 有一些微小的改进
okay, minor new improvements here and there,

64
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:22,619
但主要还是加入了不少新的人工智能功能
but mainly just a bunch of new AI features

65
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,991
以及各种新功能
and capabilities.

66
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:29,116
我很高兴Pixel的硬件设计也
I'm glad that the Pixel also got a bunch of meaningful feeling

67
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,257
很有深意
hardware stuff too.

68
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:31,078
显然 没错
And then obviously, yes

69
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,382
这个手机的边框确实是方方正正的
you do have the squared off sides that I just know

70
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,925
这正好和世界上的iPhone、三星等手机相匹配
are supposed to fit in with the iPhones and Samsungs of the world.

71
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:38,545
我之前提到过
I've said it before

72
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,307
我喜欢它的造型和触感
I like the look and feel.

73
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,750
这同样适用于这个新的相机罩
And that also applies to this new camera visor

74
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,512
这看起来不太像面罩 反而更像个架子
which is less of a visor

75
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,787
我想它更像一个架子 再加上面罩的功能
and I guess more of like a shelf visor.

76
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:50,127
在一些渲染中 岛的样子看起来有点奇怪
Island now kind of looks a bit weird in some renders

77
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:53,008
不过你得相信我 亲自看过的人都会觉得不错
but you just kind of have to trust me seeing it in person

78
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:53,809
这个真是太棒了！
It's fire.

79
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,068
我很喜欢 尽管它可能会
I like it Even if it will

80
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,889
如果和去年一样 它肯定会在角落里积满灰尘
totally collect dust in just the same way as last year in the corners.

81
00:03:58,889 --> 00:03:59,430
这个真的不错
It's nice

82
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,431
现在有个新尺寸 适合想要专业手机的
Oh, and I almost forgot there is a new size so you can have a pro phone

83
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:07,312
而且它不是XL 我非常喜欢这个选择！
but without it being an XL Love the choice.

84
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,032
我有点儿担心
I am a little worried

85
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:12,395
那个可能不如两个极端的型号卖得好
that that one is probably won't sell as well as the two extremes

86
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:13,377
不过我只是想说
but I'm just

87
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:14,717
我很高兴今年我们有更多选择
I'm glad we have the choice this year.

88
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:17,360
趁它还在的时候要好好珍惜
Be happy about it before it gets discontinued.

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,482
总的来说 这听起来不错
So anyway, it all sounds pretty good

90
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,742
不过我还是有些不满
but I do have a few gripes

91
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:22,843
我觉得这是合情合理的
which I'm allowed to

92
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:23,985
它的价格是1000美元
it's $1,000.

93
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:27,648
所以电池的大小和去年差不多
So the size of the batteries is about the same as last year,

94
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:30,870
小型号的电池容量大约是4700毫安时
4,700 milliamp hours in the smaller size ones,

95
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,052
大手机的电池容量大约是5000毫安时
5,000 milliamp hours in the big phone.

96
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,533
我在使用XL时 电池续航一直表现不错
I've had pretty good battery life

97
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,077
与XL一起使用的电池续航表现较差
like a minus battery life with the XL consistently

98
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:42,279
屏幕亮度高的情况下 使用时间超过五小时
five plus hours of screen on time lots of heavy high brightness use

99
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:45,221
不过 它们充电速度仍然不快
but they still don't charge that fast

100
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:49,446
XL的最大充电功率大约是37瓦特
like the XL is maxing out at like 37 watts.

101
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:51,846
而且在小型号的手机上 充电速度实际上更慢
And it's actually slightly slower on the smaller phones.

102
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:55,189
我不是说你必须使用那种‘真我320瓦特’的极快充电
Now I'm not saying you gotta go thermonuclear level

103
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:58,271
真我320瓦特极快充电
real me 320 watt fast charging

104
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,833
充电速度快得让人惊讶
light your phone on fire charging speeds or anything like that.

105
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,874
我只是想说 快速充电还是挺不错的
I'm just saying fast charging would be nice.

106
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:06,696
就50到60瓦 这样就好了
50, 60 watts, that's it.

107
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,877
我觉得这也没什么特别的
I feel like that's just not that insane

108
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:11,538
但是在使用手机方面会好很多
but would be significantly better for using the phone.

109
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:15,600
我还得提一下 Pixel 9的边框是哑光的 背面是光滑的
Now, I also need to say Pixel 9 has matte sides with glossy back

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,682
而Pixel 9 Pro的边框是光滑的 背面是哑光的
but the Pixel 9 Pro has glossy sides with the matte back.

111
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:21,221
这种设计我们以前见过
We've seen the strategy before.

112
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,663
我觉得哑光的边框外观更好看
I just think the matte sides look

113
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,682
而且手感也比光滑的要好得多
and feel so much better than the glossy

114
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,865
我有点希望能有哑光效果的手机外观
so I kind of wish you could get like a matte on matte look

115
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,125
不过这只是我个人的看法
but that's just me.

116
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,185
还有一件事
And then one more thing, of course

117
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,706
这些手机的起售价很高
these phones start at higher prices

118
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,666
或者基础版的起售价是799美元
or at least the base one starts at $799

119
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,607
不过这款手机要1000美元 128GB的存储起步
but this is a $1,000 phone that starts at 128 gigs of storage.

120
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,452
谢谢你 苹果
Thanks, Apple.

121
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:41,872
我想这也是现在的趋势了
I guess that's the standard now too

122
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:42,812
但是现在是2024年
but it's 2024.

123
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:45,434
我希望起步存储能是256GB
I would have liked, you know, 256 to start.

124
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:53,158
相机一直是谷歌手机体验中不可或缺的一部分
So cameras have always been a big part of the Google phone experience

125
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:54,759
至少最近一段时间是这样
or at least they have for a while now.

126
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,860
而在Pixel 9系列中
And on Pixel 9s

127
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,401
这个依然成立 但情况有所不同
that's still true, but not in exactly the same way.

128
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,802
总体而言
So all across the board

129
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:04,504
Pixel 9和9 Pro的主摄像头是相同的
the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro actually share the same primary camera

130
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:06,146
超广角镜头也是相同的
and the same ultra-wide.

131
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:10,048
Pro版则多了一个5倍变焦的长焦镜头
The Pros just get that extra telephoto, the 5x zoom

132
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,908
所有机型共享的主摄像头
And the primary camera that they all share

133
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:14,050
基本和去年一样
is basically the same as last year.

134
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,069
超广角镜头是全新设计
The ultra wide is new.

135
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,949
现在是48百万像素 而不是以前的12百万
It's 48 megapixels instead of 12

136
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,211
但最终分辨率降低到了12
but it bends down to 12.

137
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,750
来看看用这些新相机拍摄的效果吧
So look shooting with these new cameras.

138
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,370
效果非常不错！
It's great.

139
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,351
这是一款非常快速的手机相机应用
It's a quick smartphone camera app.

140
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,331
有许多简单易用的模式
There's a bunch of easy to use modes.

141
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,613
反应非常灵敏
It's responsive.

142
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:28,793
对焦速度很快
Focus is quick.

143
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,132
使用起来非常简单 表现也很稳定
It's easy, a consistent

144
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,653
能够快速处理出清晰的好照片
good pictures that process pretty quickly.

145
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,564
我对这些照片最深刻的印象是
What I mostly notice about these photos.

146
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:38,007
在我看来 它们看起来仍然处理得很夸张
is they still look very processed to me.

147
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,850
这就是目前几代 Pixel 手机的风格
Like this is the pixel look now these days with the last few generations.

148
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,413
这张照片有丰富的 HDR、高对比度
Just lots of HDR, lots of contrast,

149
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:47,875
和动态范围 同时也经过了较强的锐化处理
lots of dynamic range, also lots of sharpening.

150
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,238
这种效果没有我们在其他设备上看到的自然
It's just not as natural of a look as we've seen in some others.

151
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,101
这效果显得更加鲜明
It's just more on the punchy side

152
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,843
这对于在社交媒体上分享照片很好
which is honestly great for just sharing a photo on social media

153
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:58,769
但有些人可能更喜欢中性风格的照片
but some may prefer a more neutral photo.

154
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:01,350
Pro的新自拍相机在细节上
The new selfie camera on the Pro actually feels like

155
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,271
真的是最大的提升
the biggest improvement

156
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,290
在细节上
as far as detail

157
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,673
与普通Pixel 9相比 色彩更加丰富
and color over the regular Pixel 9

158
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:06,952
但它没有这一点
which doesn't get this.

159
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:09,714
不过我认为这款自拍相机非常不错
But I'd say this is a pretty nice selfie camera.

160
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:12,355
动态范围真是超广
Just so much dynamic range.

161
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:13,255
如果你想了解的话
But if you want to see

162
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,877
还可以听听Pixel拍摄的视频效果
and hear what video footage from the Pixel sounds like

163
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:20,759
我在Pixel 9 Pro XL的自动对焦频道上录制了一整段视频
I shot an entire video on the autofocus channel on the Pixel 9 Pro XL

164
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,000
在4K 30帧下
in 4K 30

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,922
完全没有外接硬件
with actually no external hardware.

166
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,002
我连麦克风都没插
I didn't even plug in a mic.

167
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,755
这就是设备自带的麦克风效果
This is just the built-in mics.

168
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,341
就我拿着手机
so yeah just me holding a phone

169
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:31,730
不放大根本看不出问题
if you don't zoom in at all the videos look great

170
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,668
清晰 但明显处理过头了
they're sharp but obviously still very processed.

171
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:38,269
你能看出来 它在优先处理图像分割
And you can see it like prioritizing segmentation

172
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,971
还有我脸上的灯光和颜色的变化
and like lighting on my face and shifting colors around.

173
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,952
我会在下面放个链接
So I'll leave a link below

174
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:44,954
如果你想看完整的eSprinter评测
if you want to watch that whole eSprinter review when it goes live.

175
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,055
顺便去那边订阅
And you might as well subscribe over there

176
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,516
其他汽车视频吧
while you're at it for other car videos.

177
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,216
不过这都是Pixel体验的一部分
But this is all part of the Pixel experience.

178
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,478
就像他们还在不断调试这些相机
Just like they're still tuning these cameras.

179
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:54,959
将来它们可能会显得更自然一些
They may end up looking a little more natural in the future

180
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,620
尽管已经过了一代人
even though it's been a generation.

181
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,002
这就是从这款手机中可以体验到的一项功能
Like that's one of the things that you can get out of this phone.

182
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,865
不过当他们展示这些东西时
But also when they present these things

183
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:07,598
这全是关于功能、智能和那些疯狂的AI魔法编辑器
it's all about the features, the smarts, the crazy AI magic editor

184
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,220
还有这些手机上的所有AI技术
and all this AI stuff on these phones.

185
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,521
Pixel体验有很多值得期待的地方
There's a lot to the Pixel experience.

186
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,327
所以说 谷歌是Android的开发者
So, Google makes Android.

187
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,670
谷歌还自己制造Android手机
Google makes their own Android phone.

188
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,473
所以 谷歌安卓手机应该是
Therefore, the Google Android phone should be the vessel

189
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,935
展示安卓最新功能的最佳选择
for showing off the latest and greatest

190
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,884
来自安卓 是吧？
from Android, right?

191
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:35,125
我说的是 安卓15的预览在二月刚曝光
I mean, Android 15 preview just got shown off in February.

192
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,086
将在年底发布
It's coming out by the end of the year.

193
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,706
这些手机预装安卓14
These phones launch with Android 14.

194
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:42,067
这可不是开玩笑
That's not a joke.

195
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,128
所有这些Pixel 9都运行安卓的第二最新版本
All these Pixel 9s are running the second latest version of Android

196
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,107
出厂时
out the box.

197
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,469
显然 他们应该是优先获得安卓15的
Obviously, they should be first in line for 15

198
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:51,509
然后是七年的软件更新承诺
and then the seven years of promised software updates

199
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,129
但这真是太搞笑了
but that's still hilarious.

200
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,549
每次我重新使用 Pixel
But every time I go back to using a Pixel, you know

201
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:59,691
我想起了用其他手机时错过的功能
I'm reminded of all this stuff that I miss when I use other phones,

202
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,138
比如通话筛选
like call screening.

203
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:01,758
实在是太好了
So good.

204
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,961
我知道三星的 Bixby 版本有点糟糕
I mean, I know Samsung kind of has like a janky Bixby version of it

205
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,160
可效果比不上 Pixel
but it doesn't work as well.

206
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,381
我尝试过
I've tried.

207
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,982
还有一个现在播放的功能
The now playing feature also

208
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,443
它会在你身边悄悄地告诉你
that just kind of ambiently tells you

209
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:11,965
正在播放的歌曲
what song is playing in the background

210
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,206

wherever you're at.

211
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,326
我超喜欢这个
Love it.

212
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:17,589
而且现在他们又增加了很多新功能
And now there's all this new stuff that they're adding

213
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,711
这可能会让人们对Pixel感兴趣
that also may or may not hook people to the Pixel.

214
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,312
所以通话备注是一个新功能
So call notes is a new one.

215
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,253
挺实用的
Pretty useful.

216
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:27,235
对正在通话进行录音并总结
Summarize the phone calls that you're on with a recording.

217
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,250
新的Pixel天气应用最初我以为不怎么样
And the new Pixel weather app Originally

218
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,374
我原本没打算太看重它 但说实话
I wasn't going to give that much of a chance to it, but honestly

219
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,154
它的表现与我用过的其他
it's turned out to be just as good as basically any other

220
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,336
Android天气应用一样好
Android weather app I've tried.

221
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,976
点击主页上的天气小部件即可使用
So you can get to it by tapping the weather widget on the home screen

222
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,918
界面设计得很漂亮
and it's got this really pretty UI

223
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,879
你可以在这里重新排列大图标
where you can rearrange the big tiles

224
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,980
把你最关心的内容放在前面
and put the ones you care most about closer to the top.

225
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,803
虽然它不允许你更改天气来源 但我想说
It doesn't let you change your weather source, but I mean

226
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,403
我这算是为难
I'm already nitpicking at a level

227
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:55,485
那些只在意细节的天气爱好者了
that only weather nerds will really care about.

228
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:59,736
他们还加了新版全景界面和相机功能
And they also threw in an updated panorama UI and the camera.

229
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,677
不过我不知道还有谁会在意这个
And I don't know if anybody cares about this

230
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:05,620
但Pro版的温度传感器现在可以测量人体温度了
but the temperature sensor in the Pros works on people now.

231
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,360
不知道你有没有注意到这一点
I don't know if you caught that.

232
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,701
而且它现在能提供实时温度读数
And it gives these live temperature readings now

233
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,582
在你环绕物体时
as you move around an object

234
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,583
顺带说明 这些并不算医疗建议
none of which is medical advice, by the way.

235
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,184
我真的是有点佩服谷歌的坚持
I'm actually impressed by Google's commitment

236
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:18,346
对这个特别无用的应用
to this particularly useless app.

237
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:21,087
毕竟 谷歌 我知道你们因取消项目而受到批评
Like, Google, I know you get a lot of heat for killing things typically

238
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:25,952
但我觉得你们可以放弃这个温度计应用
but I give you permission to stop working on the thermometer app, I think.

239
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:26,633
我觉得你们做到了
I think you've done it.

240
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,953
不过 有一点我想再提一下
But there's one thing that, again

241
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:30,514
如果你看了谷歌的活动
if you watched Google's event

242
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:33,355
这正是让Pixel与其他
that is really supposed to stand the pixel out from the rest

243
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:35,015
智能手机不同之处
of the world of smartphones.

244
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:39,157
这正是双子星运作的地方
And that is because this is where Gemini lives.

245
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:43,759
这与谷歌最新助手的整合非常深入
This is this deep, deep integration with Google's newest assistant here.

246
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,159
这款手机的开机动画竟然是谷歌的图标
Literally the boot up animation on this phone is the Google logo.

247
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,740
启动时 它会变成双子座的图标
And then it turns into the Gemini logo before it starts up.

248
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,066
其实这些就是...
Like these are basically...

249
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,386
就是双子座手机
Gemini phones.

250
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,087
那么 让我们聊聊这个
So let's talk about it.

251
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,991
我们先撇开谷歌这种让人困惑的品牌更名惯例不谈
So ignoring the fact that Google has this horrible habit of rebranding

252
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:09,114
以及那种让人困惑的重新命名方式
and renaming things in the most confusing way possible

253
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:13,355
显然 我们在这里应该聚焦于双子座
it seems clear that Gemini is the thing we should be focusing on here.

254
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:15,976
这个小盒子肩负着很大的压力
Like there's a lot of pressure on this little box

255
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,178
必须尽量做到实用
to be as useful as possible.

256
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:24,182
而且它确实表现不错 我觉得双子助手很实用
And it actually delivers like I have found Gemini to be very useful

257
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:27,964
而且最近几周它也在迅速改进
and also rapidly improving over the past couple weeks

258
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:29,945
增加了不少新功能
and gaining new capabilities

259
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:32,566
它仍然能够很好地进行对话 记得上下文
and it's still it's very conversational remembers context

260
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:36,307
绝大多数情况下能正确回答问题 表现不错
it gets questions correct most the time it's good

261
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,869
我显然需要更新一下助手的比较
I clearly need to do an updated assistant battle

262
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,909
因为我上次比较的是谷歌助手 而不是双子
because the last one I did was with Google Assistant not Gemini

263
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,518
但这真是奇怪
but see that's the weird thing

264
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:51,082
谷歌居然向大家推出了这个全新的Gemini助手
Google introduced this huge new Gemini assistant to everyone

265
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:55,385
而且谷歌助手在这些手机上仍然
but also Google Assistant still exists

266
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:58,509
和Gemini助手同时存在
alongside Gemini on these phones too.

267
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,690
就好像有两个不同的助手
Like it's two different assistants.

268
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,011
其实 有一段时间
Matter of fact, for a little while

269
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:06,394
谷歌助手实际上比Gemini更强
Google Assistant was actually better than Gemini at a lot of things

270
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,255
普通人使用的功能
for what regular people were doing with it

271
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:11,198
因为Gemini助手不能设定定时器
because Gemini couldn't set timers

272
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,159
它不能提供去某个地方的路线
it couldn't get directions to places

273
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,586
它也无法进行基本的家居控制
it couldn't do basic home controls.

274
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:17,907
因此 谷歌助手将成为人们依赖的工具
And so Google Assistant would be the thing

275
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:18,986
人们还是会依赖它
that it would fall back on

276
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:21,268
而且人们也会持续使用
and that people would continue to use.

277
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,068
这让人感到困惑
It's confusing.

278
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:23,969
即使是现在的Pixel 9
Even now on the Pixel 9

279
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,470
你只需长按电源按钮
you can hold down the power button

280
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,110
或从角落向上滑动 打开Gemini
or swipe up from the corner to get to Gemini.

281
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,613
但每部手机上都有的Pixel主屏幕小部件
But the permanent Pixel home screen widget on everyone's phone

282
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,572
如果你点一下那个麦克风
if you tap that microphone

283
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:36,863
那就是旧版的谷歌助手了
that's the old Google Assistant.

284
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:41,807
如今 Gemini实际上可以设置计时器和闹钟
But today, now, Gemini can actually set timers and alarms.

285
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:44,909
它能够听取背景音乐 告诉你正在播放的是什么歌曲
And it can listen and tell you what song is playing in the background

286
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,191
但之前它是无法做到的
when it couldn't before.

287
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:50,715
它可以进行智能家居控制 比如调节Nest恒温器的温度
And it can do home controls like changing my Nest thermostat temperature

288
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,596
和开启智能灯
and turning smart lights on.

289
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:55,110
但不知为何
But for some weird reason

290
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,173
当它具备这些新能力时
when it's doing all of these new capabilities

291
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:02,197
角落里显示个小Google助手标志
it's showing me a little Google Assistant logo in the corner

292
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,677
仿佛在告诉我 ‘好的’
as if to tell me like, okay

293
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,120
它能正常运作 还有新功能
it works and we have this new capability

294
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,003
不过双子星是依赖旧版Google助手来完成这些功能的
but Gemini is doing this through the old Google Assistant

295
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:12,105
那这有什么必要告诉我？
which why even tell me that?

296
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,505
直接去做吧
Just do the thing.

297
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:16,307
总之 在设置里也有这些功能
So anyway, then also in the settings

298
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,870
你可以使用这些双子星扩展
you'll be able to have these Gemini extensions

299
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,148
启用后
which when you enable them

300
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:23,711
这将使双子星更深入了解你的生活 通过其他应用
will let Gemini see more into your actual life, like through other apps

301
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:27,053
例如Google文档、Google云端硬盘和日历
like Google Docs and Drive and your calendar.

302
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,956
对我而言 这才是最有用的地方
And to me, that's really where it becomes the most useful.

303
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,738
我开始请求它帮我找邮件
Like I start asking it to find emails for me

304
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:36,041
告诉我下一个日历事件的交通情况
and tell me the traffic to my next calendar event and things like that.

305
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,423
这就像跟一个普通人在交流 特别实用
That is just like talking to a normal person and it's super useful.

306
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:44,908
不过 Gemini Live 有时会让人感觉不太舒适
But then Gemini Live gets into this slightly less comfortable sometimes,

307
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,235
但也时常非常有用
but also sometimes very useful.

308
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:49,216
可以跟Gemini进行完全交谈
fully conversational mode with Gemini.

309
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:52,839
所以你就这么打开它 它就会全屏了
So you just open it like this and it's full screen.

310
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,139
好吧 我的工作室里有个黄蜂巢
So, okay, I've got this wasp nest in my studio

311
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,160
我得把它处理掉
and I need to get rid of it.

312
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,601
我该怎么做？
What do I do?

313
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,023
黄蜂比较凶猛
Wasps are pretty aggressive,

314
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:05,663
因此安全清除蜂巢是重中之重
so getting rid of the nest safely is the priority.

315
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,804
你知道蜂巢里是哪种黄蜂吗？
Do you know what kind of wasps are in the nest?

316
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,746
这样我就能找到帮你清除它的最好方法
That will help me figure out the best way to help you remove it.

317
00:14:10,746 --> 00:14:11,466
我完全没主意
I have no idea

318
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,768
不过它们总是活跃得很
but they're all really active all the time.

319
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:17,591
好吧 这说得通
Okay, that makes sense.

320
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,152
首先 最好试着
To start, it's best to try

321
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:21,331
弄清楚你遇到的是什么种类的黄蜂
and figure out what kind of wasps you're dealing with.

322
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,533
它们是黄黑相间、腰身细长的吗？
Are they yellow and black with a narrow waist?

323
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,133
如果是这样 那它们可能是黄蜂
If so, they're probably yellow jackets.

324
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,594
还是它们更像棕色的？
Or are they more brown

325
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:29,073
还是灰色的 腰部更宽一些？
or gray with a wider waist?

326
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,094
那它们是纸巢蜂
Those would be paper wasps.

327
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:30,495
你知道吗？
You know what?

328
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,735
我可不想跟它们靠这么近
I don't want to get that close to them.

329
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:34,014
我还是去找附近的灭虫服务吧？
How about I just find pest control nearby?

330
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:34,495
你能帮我搞定吗？
Can you do that?

331
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:36,916
好的 那就这样
Okay.

332
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,726
所以这一切都得看你的网络好不好了
So this is all at the mercy of your internet connection.

333
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:44,447
而且不能出错 保持信息完整
and it not hallucinating and getting everything right.

334
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,447
不过一旦它实现
But when it does, it's actually

335
00:14:46,447 --> 00:14:47,206
那确实会非常有用
it can be super useful

336
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:48,327
特别是当你有很多
especially when you have like a bunch of

337
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,207
后续问题时
follow-up questions about something

338
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,827
你就会想继续深入
and you want to just keep going

339
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:55,009
这样就不需要在谷歌上打字 只需直接说话即可
then it's less of a bunch of typing Google and just talking to it.

340
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:55,908
没问题
It's fine.

341
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:59,789
所以我觉得 Gemini现在真的做得不错
So I do think Gemini is actually really good at this point.

342
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:05,971
当然 我打算与新Siri进行比较
I will plan on doing a comparison to the new Siri, of course

343
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,091
也会对比ChatGPT和其他一些助手
probably ChatGPT and probably some others

344
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,142
欢迎大家订阅！
in some Updated assistant battle feel free to get subscribed

345
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:14,245
如果你想等它发布 那就得等等了
if you want to see that when it comes out, but as of right now

346
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:19,130
是的 我很喜欢Gemini助手的功能
Yeah, I'm I'm a fan of what assistant assistant of what Gemini is doing

347
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,921
但实际上 使用Gemini你可以在任何安卓手机上完成这些功能
but the thing is you can do any of this with Gemini on any android phone

348
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:30,403
实际上 谷歌用Galaxy S24 Ultra演示了Gemini
matter of fact google literally demoed gemini with the galaxy s24 ultra

349
00:15:30,403 --> 00:15:31,864
在自己的活动中
at their own event

350
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,604
就连他们都没打算掩饰这一点
like they didn't even try to hide it

351
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:35,225
那么如果这并不是Pixel独有的
so if that's not unique to pixel

352
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,625
那么如果这就是Gemini手机
and it's basically the gemini phone

353
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,566
那新NPU的强大又有什么意义呢
like what's the point of all this new npu power

354
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,167
搭配Tensor G4
with the tensor g4

355
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:46,048
这些额外用于人工智能的内存究竟有什么用呢？
and all this extra ram dedicated to ai tasks what exactly is that good for

356
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:50,210
其实还有不少其他的人工智能任务
well there are a bunch of other ai tasks

357
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,993
所以我打算这样来分析这些功能
So here's how I want to go through these.

358
00:15:56,993 --> 00:16:00,754
Pixel 9有许多新推出的人工智能功能
There's a bunch of new AI features on the Pixel 9s

359
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:08,976
我想把它们分成有用的、一般的和噱头设计
and I want to just sort of divide them into useful, meh, and gimmicks

360
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:11,097
这是我这段时间使用它们的亲身体验
based on my own experience with them over the past couple weeks.

361
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:12,398
我都尝试了一下这些功能
I've been trying them all, using them

362
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,958
对它们做了全面的测试
putting through their paces

363
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:14,979
我有一些看法
and I have some thoughts.

364
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,139
所以其中一些功能确实相当不错
So some of them are really good

365
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,921
这增强了Pixel的使用体验 还有其他优点...
and add to the Pixel experience, and others...

366
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,495
其实并没那么好 有点被高估了
Not that great, kind of overrated.

367
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:26,496
总的来说 在实用性上 我觉得Gemini还是有用的 毕竟它只是一个助手
So under useful, I'm putting Gemini, of course, just the assistant overall.

368
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:29,077
反应很快 处理得也不错 整体不错
It's quick, it gets things right, fine.

369
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:33,837
接下来是通话记录、视频增强功能 还有‘加我’的选项
Then I have call notes, video boost, and add me.

370
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:37,359
视频增强似乎在画质上确实带来了意想不到的变化
So video boost actually seems to make a surprising difference at

371
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,960
视频质量真是不错
how good the video quality comes out of a pixel

372
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,980
你能从这些功能中获得的体验也很丰富
and what you can get out of these.

373
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,105
通话记录功能很方便
call notes is is convenient

374
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,827
因为如果你敢在通话中启用这个功能
because if you have the guts to turn it on on a phone call

375
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:50,409
它可以记录所有内容并进行转录和总结
it can record everything in just at all transcribe it summarize it

376
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,931
而且通话结束后会把内容发送给你
and give you that after the phone call

377
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,251
这功能真是太实用了
which is it's just useful

378
00:16:54,251 --> 00:17:00,153
然后加我一下 哈哈 这听起来很有趣 很不错
and then add me haha had me add me is interesting it's good

379
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,654
它的效果不错
It works pretty well.

380
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,475
我只是觉得
I just

381
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:05,355
我不太确定人们是否会真正使用它
I'm not sure if people are going to actually use it

382
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,797
或者他们只是试一次就不再用了
or if they're going to like try it once

383
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:07,656
然后就把它忘了
and then forget about it

384
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:08,836
然后再回去拍自拍
and go back to taking selfies.

385
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,597
但它好用 能正常发挥功能
But it does what it's supposed to.

386
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,219
就在那个人像模式旁边
It's right there next to the portrait mode.

387
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,159
使用相机时很容易找到
It's easy to access in the camera.

388
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,000
如果你需要拍团体照
And so if you need to take a group shot

389
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,560
而你又没有人帮你拍
and you actually have no one to take it for you

390
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,741
这个功能真的很实用
this feature is genuinely useful.

391
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,542
它只需合并两张照片 哇
It just combines two pictures and boom

392
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,242
现在所有人都在照片里了
everyone's now on the photo.

393
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,304
你可能在想 没错
In case you were wondering, yes

394
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:30,136
你可以和自己一起拍照
you can do add me with yourself.

395
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,838
是的 如果你仔细看像素细节
And yes, if you pixel peep

396
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:34,840
你会发现它并不是每次都完美
you can tell that it's not perfect every single time.

397
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,423
边缘有些模糊
There are fuzzy edges.

398
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,746
显然是用了第一张照片的基本框架
It's clearly using the base frame from the first photo

399
00:17:39,746 --> 00:17:42,548
然后再合成最后一个人
and then compositing in the last person.

400
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:46,853
不过 总体来说 谷歌做得这么深入
But in general, the fact that Google has leaned this far in

401
00:17:46,853 --> 00:17:49,295
还凭空创造了一个非常实用的功能
and created a genuinely useful feature out of thin air

402
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:51,336
简直抛弃了现实
by just abandoning reality

403
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,768
在 Pixel 相机应用里 我想是这样的
in the Pixel camera app I guess, yeah

404
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:55,648
你得给他们点个赞啊
you gotta give them credit.

405
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:57,970
但人们真的知道怎么用这个吗？
It's just will people actually know to use this

406
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,832
他们会往常一样拍自拍吗？
or will they just go back to taking like a selfie with everyone behind them

407
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,173
这样就能把每个人都拍进来？
so they get everyone in the shot?

408
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:03,094
我也不太清楚
I don't know.

409
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:03,815
时间会告诉我们
Only time will tell.

410
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,395
所以那个就有点无聊了
So then there's meh.

411
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,896
还有些还不错的东西
There's like the okay stuff.

412
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:12,060
在新的天气应用里 我能看到新的天气摘要
So I have the new weather summaries in the new weather app.

413
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,402
这些是人工智能生成的
They're AI generated.

414
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,622
在应用的最上方
So right at the top of the app there

415
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:17,324
上面会给你介绍今天的情况
it gives you some text to describe the day for you

416
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:21,396
这样你就不用看那些烦人的数字了
so you don't have to look at all those confusing numbers underneath.

417
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:24,580
老实说 这有时候还挺有用的
Honestly, it's actually kind of useful sometimes.

418
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,805
不过这真的是人工智能吗？
But is this really AI?

419
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,829
也许这个句子的结构是来自某种语言模型？
Like, maybe the sentence structure is coming from an LLM or something?

420
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,457
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:32,877
无所谓
Whatever.

422
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:33,637
没问题
It's fine.

423
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:36,961
它肯定没跟我说这些云要来了
It certainly didn't tell me about all this clouds coming in,

424
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,141
可能还会下雨
probably gonna dump some rain

425
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:39,883
还会影响我的光线
and also ruin my lighting.

426
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:44,144
但魔法编辑器推出了一个新功能
But then Magic Editor got this re-imagine feature

427
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,287
可以让你突出图像的任意部分
that lets you highlight any part of an image

428
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:49,048
然后输入一些文本 让你的照片焕然一新
and then enter some text to turn it into something else

429
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:52,090

completely different to have your photos look like

430
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,411
我也不太清楚
I don't know

431
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,777
一个幻想世界 没发生过的事情
a fantasy land or something that also never happened.

432
00:18:55,777 --> 00:19:00,179
它就是不愿意处理我那些更戏剧化的编辑
It does outright refuse to do some of my more dramatic edits.

433
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,400
就像 它好像从来不想重新想象人物
Like, it doesn't seem to want to reimagine people ever.

434
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,519
但是 它会高兴地给背景加一些物体
But it'll happily add objects to the background

435
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,981
或者 还能改变场景
or change the setting entirely if you're into that.

436
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,461
这我就不知道了
I don't know.

437
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,862
照片到底算什么呢？
What is a photo anyway?

438
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:14,503
最后一个 虽然也没什么特别的
And then the last meh, but not least, or whatever

439
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:18,164
这是截图应用
is the Screenshots app.

440
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,672
我是不是漏掉了什么？
am i missing something here

441
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,693
我的意思是 我明白这个前提
i mean i get the premise

442
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:26,434
你手机里有一些截图
you have some screenshots on your phone that you've taken

443
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:30,117
为了保存一些重要信息
where you want to save some critical information in them

444
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,479
他们设计了一个存储空间
so they built a place

445
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,740
你可以把这些截图整理成不同的集合
where you can organize them all into collections

446
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,241
这非常方便 你可以搜索
which is convenient you can search through them

447
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,303
还可以设置特定日期提醒
you can have it remind you at a certain date

448
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,805
以及特定截图的时间
and time of a specific screenshot

449
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:46,008
甚至可以直接链接到截图的网页
and even link you back to the web page that you took a screenshot of

450
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,556
这使得所有信息都能被搜索
and it makes all this information searchable.

451
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,477
不过 我在想...
But I'm sitting here thinking

452
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:53,417
难道这不应该已经在谷歌照片里集成了吗？
shouldn't this have been built into Google Photos?

453
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,799
你知道吗 三星的照片应用其实已经实现了
Like, did you know that Samsung's Photos app already built in

454
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,859
智能链接
the smart linking

455
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,820
可以链接到任何你截图的网站
to any website you take a screenshot of?

456
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,842
我是说 别搞错了
I mean, don't get me wrong.

457
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:01,642
它是有效的
It works.

458
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:03,282
它做到了该做的事
It does what it's supposed to.

459
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,262
我猜
My theory is it's

460
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:09,265
他们可能对每张照片中的文本和信息进行了更多分析
they're probably doing slightly more analysis, more processing

461
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:12,787
对每张照片的文本和信息进行了处理
of all the bits of text and information in each photo.

462
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,989
比起普通的 Google Photos 应用 他们的表现更佳
than they would with the normal Google Photos app.

463
00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:19,430
这正是使所有索引和功能得以实现的原因
So that is what enables all the indexing and everything.

464
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,710
如果一切顺利的话
And then maybe if it goes well

465
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,671
他们是不是也会把这些添加到照片应用里呢？
they'll also bring all that to the Photos app, maybe?

466
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,152
要是进展不顺利的话
Or if it doesn't go well

467
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,212
他们是不是可以轻松放弃呢？
then they can kill it easily?

468
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:28,972
我不太确定
I don't know.

469
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:29,792
没事 随便吧
Whatever.

470
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:30,793
没事 挺好的
It's fine.

471
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:34,053
不过比起我那一段的花招 这还算不错
That's not, though, as bad as my gimmicks section.

472
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,714
放大增强 真的来了……
So Zoom Enhance...

473
00:20:36,872 --> 00:20:37,632
你听说了吗？
Have you heard about this?

474
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:40,273
照片应用终于推出了新编辑功能！
There's a new edit feature finally shipping in the Photos app

475
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:44,395
鼓励你尽情放大照片
that encourages you to zoom all the way in on a photo

476
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,816
然后就可以体验它的像素处理效果
and then let it do its pixel magic

477
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:48,836
它会播放一段动画 仿佛
where it plays this whole animation like it's going to

478
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:49,997
要重现你的照片
reconstruct your photo

479
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,357
并揭露隐藏的细节
and find some hidden details.

480
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,098
但它其实并没做到
But it kind of never does.

481
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:54,698
说到底
At the end of the day

482
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:57,619
它只是稍微提高了清晰度滤镜
all it does is sort of turn up the clarity filter

483
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,240
可能还加了一些假纹理效果
and maybe add what feels like some fake texture

484
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,567
我觉得这里应该有些东西
where I think there should have been some.

485
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,827
我不太信这个
I'm not buying it.

486
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,268
然后是 Pixel Studio 应用
And then there's the Pixel Studio app

487
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,948
这只是一个小而实用的应用
which is just this neat little app

488
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:11,369
可以在设备上生成新图像
to generate new images completely on device.

489
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:14,370
我并不是说它不起作用
And again, what I'm not saying is that it doesn't work.

490
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,971
它在设备上大约三秒就能很好地工作
It actually does work impressively well in like three seconds on device.

491
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,712
它可以生成你想要的任何内容
It can generate whatever you want.

492
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,932
我只是觉得
It's just that I don't

493
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,713
我真看不出这有什么实际用途 除了
I guess I don't really see a real genuine use for this other than just

494
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:25,393
随便玩玩
messing around,

495
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:26,734
老实说
which, hey, honestly

496
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:27,394
这样也没问题
that's fine too.

497
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:28,374
如果你只是想随意玩玩
If you just want to mess around

498
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:32,308
或者做个带腿的肉丸三明治
and make a meatball sub with legs

499
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:34,849
那就行 尽情享受吧！
then you got it, knock yourself out.

500
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,511
所以在大雨之前
So before it starts pouring rain

501
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:47,353
2024年新智能手机的趋势是
the meta with new smartphones in 2024 is, you know,

502
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,694
整体上有些小改进
slight improvements across the board,

503
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,874
而且还推出了一些炫目的新人工智能功能
but then also some splashy new AI features

504
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,156
只在最新款中可用
that are only available on the newest one

505
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:57,519
这是因为新芯片和神经核心的原因
because the new chip and the new neural cores

506
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,361
因此 这就是它特别的原因
and it's just special for that reason.

507
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,983
所以 这就是现在的情况
So that's, that's what's happening.

508
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:01,543
如果你愿意的话
And if you want

509
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:04,666
你可以轻松把这些新Pixel手机视为那种选择
you could easily throw these new Pixels into that camp.

510
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,051
不过 买这款手机的理由其实和以前的
But the reason you'd buy this phone is really just the same

511
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:10,468
Pixel一样
as ever for a Pixel.

512
00:22:10,468 --> 00:22:12,129
它是房间里最智能的手机
It's the smartest smartphone in the room

513
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:15,091
而且现在它采用了相当不错的硬件
and it's now also in a piece of kind of nice hardware

514
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:17,073
使用起来手感都很舒适
that's a pleasure to hold and use.

515
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,434
此外 还有一堆AI功能
And then there's a bunch of AI stuff on top

516
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:22,476
试试 要么喜欢就用 要么不管它
that you can try and either take it or leave it.

517
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,657
这就看你自己了
It's kind of just up to you

518
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:25,258
如果你想好好利用这些功能的话
if you want to get a bunch of use out of that stuff

519
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,140
或者连碰都不碰
or literally never touch it at all.

520
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,861
我很好奇你在下面留言
I'm curious if you leave a comment down below

521
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:31,763
你觉得哪些东西会用得上？
what sort of stuff you think you would use

522
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,044
还是直接买手机使用？
or buy the phone to use

523
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,185
或者你觉得哪些东西根本没用
or which stuff you don't think is that useful at all.

524
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:35,786
最终来说
At the end of the day

525
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:38,104
我们还得看看它的耐用性
we'll have to see how it ages

526
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:39,605
不过我觉得 Pixel 9
but I'm thinking Pixel 9

527
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:43,326
而 9 Pro 也是他们迄今为止最出色的作品之一
and 9 Pro is some of their finest work yet.

528
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:46,347
另外 特别感谢 Anker 的赞助
Also, shout out to Anker for sponsoring this video.

529
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:47,867
他们的新 Anker Prime 系列
Their new Anker Prime lineup

530
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,249
是迄今为止最先进的多设备快充产品
