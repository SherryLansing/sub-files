00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:10,759
这款标志性的战斗机即将迈入第三个十年的服役
as the iconic fighter approaches its third decade of frontline service

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,500
面临退役
and retirement.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,001
在本视频中 我们将详细了解这次升级
In this video, we take a closer look at the upgrade,

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,064
以及它的潜在用途和对空军的意义
its potential uses, and its role for the Air Force.

6
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:25,788
F-22的单架成本高达3亿美元
The F-22, costing $300 million per unit,

7
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:28,703
其开发历程漫长
had a protracted development journey.

8
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:33,406
它起源于1980年代的先进战术战斗机计划
It originated from the Advanced Tactical Fighter Initiative in the 1980s

9
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:38,890
1990年首次亮相 并于2005年完成开发
made its demonstrator debut in 1990, and completed development in 2005.

10
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:42,733
猛禽战斗机于2006年首次在日本部署
The Raptor was first deployed to Japan in 2006

11
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:49,818
并于2012年完成生产 总共只建造了195架
and finished production in 2012, with only 195 planes built.

12
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:51,859
它首次参战
It saw combat for the first time

13
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,741
在对抗伊斯兰国的空中战役中 2014年
during the air campaign against the Islamic State in 2014.

14
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:02,645
如今 F-22定期部署到太平洋地区以威慑中国
Today, the F-22 routinely deploys to the Pacific region to deter China

15
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,926
同时也部署到欧洲以威慑俄罗斯
and to Europe to deter Russia.

16
00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:10,649
尽管它外形未来感十足、难以探测 性能也极为出色
Despite its futuristic, hard-to-detect shape and blistering performance,

17
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:11,828
但本质上
in its bones

18
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:14,629
F-22是一款冷战时代的战斗机
the F-22 is a Cold War jet.

19
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,673
洛克希德设计它是为了在欧洲的基地对抗苏联
Lockheed designed it to battle the Soviet Union from bases in Europe

20
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:23,242
因此 续航能力不足实际上并不是问题
meaning poor endurance wasn't really an issue.

21
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:27,406
这架战斗机仅依靠内部燃油 航程大约为600英里
The fighter can range just 600 miles or so on internal fuel,

22
00:01:27,406 --> 00:01:29,848
足以在德国和波兰上空展开作战
plenty far enough to fight over Germany and Poland.

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,473
F-22猛禽的隐形技术与机动性的独特结合
The F-22 Raptor's unique combination of stealth and maneuverability,

24
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,316
一套出色的内部空对空导弹库
a decent internal air-to-air missile magazine

25
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:43,159
再加上一门20毫米的炮 使其成为最具优势的战斗机之一
and a 20mm gun make it one of the most dominant fighters today.

26
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:48,599
此外 这架战斗机经过数十年的逐步升级
Additionally, the fighter has been slowly upgraded over the decades

27
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,863
以维持其技术优势
to contain a qualitative edge

28
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:54,248
超越其他国家的顶级空中优势战斗机
over other nations' top air superiority fighters

29
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,370
比如中国的
like the People's Republic of China,

00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,512
J-20
J-20

31
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:58,092
还有俄罗斯的苏-57
and Russia's Su-57.

32
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:03,527
美国将中国视为主要威胁
with the United States considering China the pacing threat

33
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,948
因其对台湾的威胁
due to its designs on Taiwan

34
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,890
和其他侵略行动
and other aggressive actions

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,754
人们担心90年代设计的F-22猛禽可能面临困难
there is concern that the circa-90s design F-22 Raptor may have difficulty

36
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:16,556
在与2000年代的新型战斗机对抗时
going up against the 2000s design

37
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:17,757
成都J-20
Chengdu J-20.

38
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:23,140
然而 J-20的设计是为了应对
However, the J-20 was designed to help deal with the tyranny of distance

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,421
太平洋的地理距离问题
in the Pacific

40
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:28,245
而F-22的设计则主要针对欧洲战场
while the F-22 was designed more for the European theatre

41
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:29,705
威胁愈发迫近
where threats are closer.

42
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:34,246
尽管下一代空中优势战斗机
Despite the fact that the next generation air dominance fighter

43
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,885
已在深入研发
is well into development

44
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:37,227
不断增加
the increasing numbers

45
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:42,268
且日益先进的歼-20战斗机让美国空军感到紧张
and ever-improving J-20 jets are making the U.S. Air Force nervous.

46
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:49,030
尽管F-22猛禽的航程为460海里
Although the F-22 Raptor has a published range of 460 nautical miles

47
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,729
大约530英里
which is about 530 miles

48
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,270
并留有超巡航的余地
with some margin for supercruise

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,417
F-22在太平洋作战需要更远的航程
more range is needed for the F-22 to operate in the Pacific.

50
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:03,480
例如 五角大楼在台湾战争中最近的空军基地是
For example, the Pentagon's closest airbase for a war over Taiwan,

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,163
位于日本的嘉手纳基地
Kadena in Japan,

52
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,224
距离约450英里
is 450 miles away.

53
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:10,748
如果嘉手纳基地被中国导弹摧毁
If Kadena is knocked out by Chinese missiles,

54
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:13,331
离它最近的主要基地是美泽
the next closest major base, Misawa,

55
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,954
该基地同样在日本 距离达1400英里
also in Japan, is 1,400 miles away.

56
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:21,889
在对台湾的空战策划中 理由是有的
It's not for no reason that in planning for an air war over Taiwan

57
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,013
美国空军官员日益忽视F-22战斗机
USAF officers increasingly disregard the F-22s

58
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,433
而转而
and other fighters

59
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,316
计算最佳作战方式
and instead calculate optimal ways

60
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:33,779
远程重型轰炸机
for the service's long-range heavy bombers

61
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,381
以应对中国的入侵部队
to engage a Chinese invasion force.

62
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:42,353
F-22的作战范围为530英里 显然不足
The F-22 combat range of 530 miles is insufficient,

63
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:47,414
且美国空军现有装备中没有隐形空中加油机
and with no stealthy aerial refuelers in the U.S. Air Force's inventory

64
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:51,855
这会对航程达到700英里的歼-20造成困扰
this is going to pose a problem with J-20s with a 700-mile range

65
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:53,896
歼-20的设计目标是寻找加油机
designed to seek out refuelers

66
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,837
以及其他支援机
and other support aircraft at range.

67
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,818
鉴于这些重要的局限性和不断变化的威胁
Recognizing these critical limitations and the evolving threats

68
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,280
空军正在重资投入

78
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:39,060
低阻油箱和支架 简称 LDTP
Low Drag Tank and Pylon, or LDTP

79
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,723
这些油箱最初的设计目的是为了提高隐形能力
which were originally designed to be stealthier

80
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:46,666
其气动效率优于现有的 600 加仑燃油箱
and more aerodynamically efficient than the current 600-gallon fuel tanks.

81
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:53,072
LDTP 旨在支持外部油箱的超音速飞行
The LDTP was intended to allow supersonic flight with external tanks,

82
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,834
同时延长猛禽的飞行范围
while extending the Raptor's range.

83
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,697
据说 支架配备了智能
The pylons are reportedly equipped with intelligent

84
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:01,038
齿轮气动技术
rack-and-pinion pneumatic technology

85
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,178
能够实现精确弹射
that allows for controlled ejection.

86
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,081
在2023财年的预算申请中
In its fiscal year 2023 budget request

87
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:12,762
美国空军表示 F-22 LDTP
the U.S. Air Force noted that the F-22 LDTPs

88
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:15,322
配备了先进技术设计

94
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:36,221
并通过两个翼尖舱增强跟踪能力
and track capability via two wingtip pods.

95
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:40,264
这些系统 顾名思义 可以探测热特征
These systems, as the name implies, detect heat signatures

96
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:44,687
这让像Raptor这样的隐形战斗机能够定位敌机
allowing a stealth fighter like the Raptor to locate enemy aircraft

97
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:48,149
而不暴露自身信号
without revealing its presence via radar signals.

98
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:52,353
这也让战斗机能利用排气的热量
It also allows a fighter to use the heat from its exhaust

99
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,134

119
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:06,494
在这里你可以看到猛禽如何通过发射照明弹来进行反应
Here you can see how Raptor can respond by deploying flares

120
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:10,334
这正是F-22表演队去年在航展上所做的
as the F-22 demo team did at an air show last year.

121
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:16,697
提到导弹 F-22猛禽是首款武器平台
Speaking of missiles, the F-22 Raptor is the first weapons platform

122
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:23,040
它将接收绝密的AIM-260联合先进战术导弹
