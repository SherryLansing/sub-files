1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,032
其实 我曾经历过的最独特的驾驶体验之一
Alright so one of the most unique motoring experiences I've ever had

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:05,814
是在
personally was back

3
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,456
那时我每天都是开特斯拉
when I was daily driving a Tesla I got to drive

4
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:13,199
还借来了2008年的特斯拉跑车
and borrow the original the Tesla Roadster from 2008

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,762
真正体验到电动跑车的起源
and got to really feel the beginning

6
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:22,246
以及原本电动跑车应该有的感觉
and the experience of what original electric sports car was supposed to be

7
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:26,550
而且也能够清楚地看到此后的演变
and then obviously see the evolution that happened since then.

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,490
现在 我每天开的车是911
Now you know I'm daily driving a 911

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,787
我不禁想问
and The question I may have had is

10
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:34,608
那样的怀旧体验会是什么样的呢？
what would an equivalent throwback experience be?

11
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:38,330
不过这个车 看上去可没那么简单
And this one, it's actually not exactly what it looks like

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,430
你可能会想 哦
because you're probably thinking, oh

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,592
你是说你要开手动的老款涡轮增压车？
you're going to drive a manual OG turbo?

14
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,892
那可是辆疯得不可思议的车
That's a crazy car to drive.

15
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:45,213
不是 不是 不是 不是 不是！
No, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,974
这辆车是电动的
This one, this one's electric.

17
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:48,954
这几天
So for the past couple of days

18
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:52,996
迈尔斯和我开这辆车真的太享受了
Miles and I have had a real treat driving around this thing.

19
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,677
这是款改造过的964代保时捷911
This is a sort of remodeled 964 generation Porsche 911.

20
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,817
这车是由一家名为Sacrilege Motors的公司完全电动化
to be fully electric by a company called Sacrilege Motors

21
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,037
名字也是不无讽刺
probably appropriately named

22
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,521
因为很多人看到这个会有反应
because there's plenty of people who see this

23
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:11,146
看到电动的车 大家可能觉得有点不妥
and see electric and that feels sacrilegious

24
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,527
但接着你会看到评论
but then you see the reviews

25
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,370
以及人们对这辆车的驾驶体验评价
and what people have thought about driving this thing

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,662
看起来他们确实做得相当出色
and Seems like they've done an incredible job.

27
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:18,543
所以我特别想试一试
So I just wanted to check it out

28
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:20,483
看看这辆车的实际驾驶感受
and see how this actually drove.

29
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:26,686
结果证明 这是一种将手动原味与全新动力系统完美结合的体验
And it turns out it's an incredible combination of the manual original feel

30
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,256
与全新动力系统相结合
with this obviously new powertrain being

31
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,778
我想说 这个真的比原版要好
Well, I'll say it, better than the original.

32
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,837
回去看看
Now, if you go back and watch

33
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,441
原版《与2008年特斯拉跑车同住》的视频
that original Living with the 2008 Tesla Roadster video,

34
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,980
你会发现
you'll see, I mean

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,683
与今天的特斯拉相比 真相差甚远
it's quite a throwback from the Teslas of today.

36
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,384
屏幕明显小了很多
The screens are much smaller

37
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,925
车身也小了许多
the car is much smaller

38
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,046
电池的体积也缩小了很多
the battery is much smaller

39
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,867
各方面的发展都显得落后得多
and everything is just further behind.

40
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:50,349
这款车更加类比 虽然不是完全如此
It's more analog, but not completely.

41
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:53,590
这一代车型最早是在80年代推出的
This generation car first came out in the 80s.

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,171
这是一款1989年的经典车型
It's a 1989 model.

43
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:57,798
所以这里是没有屏幕的
And so there were no screens.

44
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,000
这真是更加怀旧的感觉
This is even more of a throwback.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,941
所以你可能会觉得 跟它一起生活挺疯狂的
And so you might think living with it would be crazy.

46
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,222
然后拿其中一辆稀有的车
And then taking one of these rare cars

47
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:07,765
把它改造成电动汽车
and going through the work of turning it into an electric car

48
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:10,206
简直是个疯狂的主意
is just a crazy idea.

49
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,608
不过我和它一起生活一段时间后
But after I've lived with it now

50
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,308
我明白为什么大多数人会这么做
I actually get why people do it.

51
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:17,072
在我的体验中 会有一些惊喜
And there may be some surprises in my experience

52
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:17,931
现在我来跟大家分享
that I'll share with you now.

53
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,393
那我们就直接进入正题吧
So let's just jump right in.

54
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:21,703
首先 这辆车真是太美丽了
So first of all, gorgeous car.

55
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,264
我可能有点偏见 因为显而易见
I might be biased because I'm obviously

56
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,064
我选择了这款深受启发的车
I chose a car that's inspired heavily by this

57
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,786
其实我也有一辆黑色的车
and I actually have a black one too

58
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:30,507
但你可以看到这是宽体车型
but you can see this is the wide body one

59
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:34,467
而且它还是一款敞篷车 也可以称作敞篷版
and it's a convertible as well so cabriolet if you want to call it that

60
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,508
有趣的地方
and the thing to note here

61
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,128
很多部件都是共享的
that's kind of interesting is there's a lot of parts

62
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:39,750
这些部件是从原版保时捷上共享的
here that are shared from the original Porsche parts

63
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,571
但也有许多新部件 比如这些轮子
but also a lot of new parts like you can see these wheels here

64
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:47,492
你可以看到这些新的Brembo刹车 基本上快放不下轮子了
you also see these new Brembo brakes that barely fit underneath the wheels

65
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:50,554
不过他们装上了Pilot Sport轮胎
and but they get in there pilot sport tires

66
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:53,597
几乎放不下
that barely fit under the fenders

67
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:55,717
后面的轮胎也很宽
and these are some big wide tires back here too

68
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,562
说实话 这些是295宽的18英寸轮圈
matter of fact what can i see these are 295 section 18 inch rims

69
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:03,284
后面的轮胎非常出色
these are some juicy tires back here

70
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,507
能匹配这辆车的动力
for the amount of power this thing puts out

71
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:08,209
这款车的输出功率为500马力和500牛米
which is 500 horsepower and 500 newton meters

72
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,776
现在 它是电动车
Now, it's electric

73
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,377
所以现在很多新车的电池都
so a lot of the cars built today have the batteries in

74
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:19,319
像一个小滑板一样 安装在车底
like this little skateboard underneath the car.

75
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,081
那么 这里的电池在哪里呢？
But where's the battery in here?

76
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,322
实际上这里有两个电池
There's actually two.

77
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,842
一个在前面
Big one in the front

78
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:24,503
另一个在后面
and big one in the back.

79
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,019
如果有机会的话
so on the off chance

80
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,460
你在进行自驾游的时候
that you're doing a road trip

81
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,621
在这辆车里 你还是有一点前备厢空间
or something in this car you do have a little bit of front trunk space

82
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:44,442
虽然不多
not a huge amount

83
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:49,824
但足以放一个适配器 或者一个小手提包
but enough for an adapter maybe a bag a carry-on size bag or so

84
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,666
而那半个电池就藏在地毯下
but that's half the battery right there

85
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,467
此外还有可调节的减震器
below that carpeting also your adjustable dampers

86
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,709
我想那是你的挡风玻璃清洗液 正是在这里
and i i think that's uh your windshield wiper fluid so there's

87
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:10,806
一半的重量就藏在这个标志性的鸭尾后面
where half the weight goes So behind this iconic ducktail

88
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:14,748
而电池的另一半则位于旧发动机的位置
where the old power plant used to be there's the other half of the battery

89
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,250
还有你的减震器 当然
and of course your dampers as well

90
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,593
不过 这真的很重 现在你能看到
but that is a whole bunch of weight so now you can see

91
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,495
重心分布得相当均匀 这里就没有储物空间了
it's kind of evenly distributed there's no more storage in here

92
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,028
前后各有一半的电池
but there's half the battery in the front half the battery in the back

93
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:29,733
一次充电大约可以行驶200英里
And in total, that's going to get you around 200 miles

94
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,675

of range on a single charge

95
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:32,795
如果你正常驾驶的话
if you drive it like normal

96
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,778
这其实很令人印象深刻
which is actually kind of impressive

97
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:36,519
毕竟 这车真的很小
because of how small this car really is.

98
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:39,762
我想 你不会指望它有很多放电池的空间
I mean, you don't expect a whole bunch of space to put battery in.

99
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,204
不过 因为电池不在底部
But since the battery is not on the floor

100
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,565
这就意味着驾驶位置
that means the driving position

101
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:46,728
内饰方面与原版的相似度比以往更高
and all this interior is closer than ever to the original.

102
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:47,990
这些是新的座椅
These are new seats.

103
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,610
不过 当然
But then, of course

104
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,471
我刚进来时
when I get in here

105
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:53,565
你将会看到大量原汁原味的保时捷 真让我想起了以前
you're going to see a whole bunch original Porsche so I remember

106
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:58,348
我之前拍过一段关于最新电动大众巴士的视频
when I made that video on the refreshed Volkswagen bus the electric one

107
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,629
ID Buzz
the ID buzz

108
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,651
很多评论都说这车挺酷的
there was a lot of comments that were like this is kind of cool

109
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,112
我觉得
I guess

110
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:06,175
我希望他们能复刻那个老款复古设计
but I wish they just took the exact old retro design

111
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,016
然后把它做成电动车
and they just made that one electric

112
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:10,658
现在我完全明白了
and I totally get it now

113
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,261
因为这辆车基本就是这样
because that's basically what this car is

114
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:17,425
我周围全是传统部件 没有任何屏幕
I am surrounded by analog parts not a single screen in sight

115
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:22,639
其实这里只给了我一个小屏幕 用于车载系统
well actually they've given me a little tiny screen here for car play

116
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,980
这根本不算是真正的屏幕
and it barely counts as a screen

117
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,100
因为这是额外配置的
because this is added extra

118
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,821
但开车时 你只需专注于方向盘
but when you're driving you're focused here on this wheel

119
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,141
还有这精致的内饰
and on this beautiful interior

120
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,903
现在它几乎就是你的仪表了 你之前见过的那个钥匙
which is basically just your gauges now you saw that key from before

121
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:40,363
这是启动汽车的方法 把钥匙直接放进去转动就可以了
this is the way to turn the car on stick the key right in there turn it

122
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:44,485
你会看到这些仪表转动 因此它们的显示变得更新了
and you see these gauges spin up so the gauges are of

123
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:48,526
这些仪表当然也进行了更新 以适应这辆车的电动特性
course updated a bit to work with the electric nature of this car

124
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:50,392
所以它在显示我的电池电量
so it's telling me my battery level

125
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,452
它还会告诉我一些其他信息
It's also going to tell me

126
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,733
我现在选的是什么驾驶模式
which drive mode I'm in

127
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,853
我现在使用了多少电量
how much power I'm using.

128
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:01,036
音效真的很棒
Great sound.

129
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,418
你可以看到我还剩下多少续航距离
You can see how much range I have left.

130
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,019
我现在是在悠闲模式
I'm in chill mode right now.

131
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,019
而那边显示的是我的速度
And over there is my speed.

132
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,521
这是一个更新的仪表盘 但保留了传统的模拟风格
So this is an updated gauge cluster, but very much analog.

133
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,762
这里是你的手刹
You've got your parking brake down here.

134
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:18,658
我现在把脚放在刹车上 准备倒车、行驶和切换空档
This is, I'll put foot on the brake, reverse, drive, neutral.

135
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,500
他们还新增了一个MagSafe电源接口
And they've actually added a MagSafe puck with power

136
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,221
便于为你的MagSafe设备充电
just to charge your MagSafe devices.

137
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,163
如果你想用CarPlay
So if you do want CarPlay

138
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,803
想把你的iPhone放在那儿的话
if you want to put your iPhone there

139
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,524
这是一项很不错的细节设计
that is a nice little touch that they've added.

140
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:36,586
虽然这辆车的其他部分都特别复古
Even though the entire rest of this car is super retro

141
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:40,392
你的新手机可以在这里充电 正好合适
you can have your brand new phone charging right there where it belongs.

142
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:40,572
不过
but

143
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:41,012
嗯
yeah

144
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:44,615
哎呀 这里的一切都让我感到无比怀旧
oh my god every single little thing happening here is such a throwback

145
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:48,036
空调的通风口就在这里 用于冷却
the air conditioning these notches here for cooling

146
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:52,059
加热也在这里 显然都是手动通风口
and heating for where the air comes out obviously all manual vents

147
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,620
这类功能我们不使用任何屏幕
we're not doing any screens for that type of stuff

148
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,880
当然 这里有锁
and of course you have your lock here

149
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,882
打开门的方法就在这个小装置
and the way you open the door is just this little thing right here

150
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:02,031
这真太棒了 我太喜欢了！
this is sick I'm loving it.

151
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,432
现在这里还有几个按钮
Now there's a couple other buttons over here

152
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:04,973
你最好了解一下
that you do want to know about,

153
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:08,334
特别是这个有感叹号的按钮
specifically this one with an exclamation point on it

154
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,716
这会把车切换到运动驾驶模式
which switches the car from chill mode

155
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,456
等一下 显示屏上写着‘启动我’
hold on it says crank me

156
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:20,759
因为它希望我将模式从舒适切换到运动
because it wants me to fully turn it on, from chill mode to sport mode.

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,858
而这些车的特点就是非常定制
And The thing about these cars is they are so kind of custom

158
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,257
几乎每一辆都是独一无二的
and like one-off built

159
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:33,139
你知道 舒适模式的再生制动效果更强
that you know there is chill mode which is more regen

160
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,781
再生效果可以达到65% 功率大约是三分之二至四分之三
65% regen and a you know two-thirds three-quarters of the power

161
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:38,521
但它们可以进行个性化调整
but they can tailor it

162
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,242
他们在为你定制汽车时 会完全按照你的要求来
when they build you the car to be exactly the way you want

163
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:45,363
运动模式的再生制动效果较低 大约在20%左右
sport mode has less regen closer to 20% regen

164
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:49,343
运动模式会再次提供全部动力 可以根据需要定制
but is giving you all of the power again all that can be customized

165
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,845
坐在这样的车里 感觉真是不可思议
but it's just crazy to me to sit in a car like this

166
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:55,124
而且能想到以前的汽车是那么小
and knowing that cars used to be so small

167
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:56,024
那时你只需伸手就能过去
that you could reach over

168
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:58,886
伸手就能碰到另一边 根本不用伸直手臂
and just Touch the other side without fully extending your arm

169
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,528
以前的汽车小得多
cars used to be so much smaller

170
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:05,069
薄得多 这车竟然没有安全气囊
so much thinner There's no airbag in this car

171
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,990
不过这里还是有雨刷的
but you've got your windshield wipers here.

172
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,891
这里还有转向灯
You've got your blinkers over here

173
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:12,274
所有东西依然在熟悉的位置上 感觉真亲切
Things are all still in the familiar places

174
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,855
这让我感到满满的怀旧情怀
but it's just such a throwback.

175
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:14,654
这真是太赞了！
It's so sick.

176
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:20,997
这是一种独特的体验 后座也很重要
This is This is a one-of-a-kind Experience you also have your back seats.

177
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:21,798
别忘了这些细节
Don't forget about those

178
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,372
我的车也有这个设计 但是几乎没法用
and My car has the same thing, barely usable.

179
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:25,533
后面不适合成年人坐
You don't want an adult back there

180
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,535
不过 如果你愿意的话 坐一下也可以
but you could do it if you want to.

181
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,718
不过 我要把驾驶体验交给迈尔斯了
But I'm going to pass it to Miles for the driving experience

182
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,178
因为我已经给你看过车内了
because I've shown you the interior.

183
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,160
我已经给你讲了基本的情况
I've shown you the basics.

184
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,682
你能开200英里 那迈尔斯
You get 200 miles of driving, so Miles

185
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,783
开起来感觉怎么样？
what's it like to drive?

186
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,306
这款车的品牌叫Sacrilege Motors
The brand of this car is Sacrilege Motors

187
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:44,789
因为对许多老派保时捷爱好者来说 这样的想法
because the idea to a lot of OG Porsche enthusiasts

188
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,032
有人会把这样的车改成电动
that someone would take a car like this

189
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:51,514
装上电动机 听起来有点疯狂 对吧？
and put electric motors inside is kind of crazy, right?

190
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,558
我觉得汽车圈其实有个大问题
And I think there's this big problem with the car community

191
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:57,360
人们认为车辆只需要分成两种
where people think it just has to be one

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,604
或是另一种类型
or the other for certain types of vehicles.

193
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:04,609
大家都觉得新的法拉利超级跑车用V6而不是V12令人失望
People are upset that the new Ferrari hypercar has a V6 instead of a V12.

194
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:05,889
不过 如果你买得起那辆车
But if you can afford that car

195
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,433
又有什么理由不去收藏12辆V12的车呢？
what's stopping you from owning 12 other cars with a V12?

196
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,916
你应该以同样的视角来看待这辆车
You should look at this car the same way.

197
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,356
如果你有接近80万美元
If you have nearly $800,000

198
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:17,719
或者花更多钱来买这样的车
or more to spend on a car like this

199
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:23,042
那还有什么能阻止你花同样的钱买一辆经典的
what's also stopping you from spending the equivalent money on a classic

200
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,842
保时捷911呢？
ICE Porsche 911?

201
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:25,964
考虑到这些情况
And so with all that in mind

202
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:26,764
我觉得这点很重要
I think it's important

203
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:30,086
我们应该避免把这与内燃机911进行比较
that we don't try to compare this to an ICE 911

204
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,947
因为如果你能买得起这辆车
because if you can afford this car

205
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,328
你也可以选择买一辆内燃机964
you can also just get an internal combustion engine 964.

206
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,971
但我想说的是 他们在这方面确实做得很出色
But what I will say... is that what they've done an amazing job at

207
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:44,255
开这款车时 唯一让你感受不到911的 可能就是它的电动动力系统
with this car is making sure the only thing that doesn't feel like a 911

208
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:48,078
就是它的动力系统是电动马达
is the fact that you have electric motors for the drivetrain.

209
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:51,681
开这车的其他每一个方面
Literally every other aspect of driving this car

210
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:54,383
甚至连气味
even down to the smells

211
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:58,927
都是你在经典保时捷911上能感受到的
is definitely what you would experience with a classic Porsche 911.

212
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:04,948
方向盘手感出色 沉稳、连接紧密 反馈非常到位
The steering field is nice, weighted, connected, super communicative.

213
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,190
让它动起来需要一些力气
takes a bit of elbow work to get it going

214
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,471
就像90年代和80年代的经典保时捷那样
just like a classic Porsche from the 90s, 80s.

215
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,052
明显地 它的底盘非常低
It's obviously super low to the ground.

216
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,732
车身非常稳固
It's very stiff

217
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:17,413
因为它配备了可调的三向悬挂
because of those three-way adjustable coilovers

218
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,235
稍后我们会详细讨论
that we'll talk about a little bit later.

219
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:20,535
接下来我们来说说它的轻盈感
And then the lightness.

220
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:26,278
这辆车的重量刚刚超过3000磅
This car only weighs just barely over 3,000 pounds

221
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,381
这使得它比市面上大多数燃油车轻得多
which makes this lighter than most gas powered cars

222
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,763
（未提供对应内容）
currently on sale today.

223
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:37,543
我们依然保持着传统911的4060重量分配
We also still have the 4060 weight distribution of a traditional 911.

224
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:41,485
因此 重量转移、整体平衡和操控性都相当出色
So weight transfer, general balance and handling

225
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:44,485
这些表现与原版车相当
it's all on par with the original car.

226
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,485
当然
But then of course

227
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:52,206
这款车配备了超过500马力和500牛顿米的扭矩
you've got 500 horsepower, just a little over 500 Newton meters of torque.

228
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,586
我会把这里转换成磅尺
I'll put the conversion here to pound feet.

229
00:10:55,908 --> 00:11:01,610
这辆车重3000磅 马力有500 并且仅为后驱
And so 3000 pounds, 500 horsepower and rear-wheel drive only.

230
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,015
这辆车相当快
This thing is quick

231
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:07,937
坦白说 有时候开起来让人有点害怕
and it's quite frankly a little scary at times

232
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:09,658
就是因为它的体积很小
just because of how small it is.

233
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:13,101
这车确实有种老派车的感觉
It certainly has that OG car feel

234
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,663
就像我们今年频道里介绍的其他车
just like other cars we've had on the channel this year,

235
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,484
比如大众ID Buzz
like the Volkswagen ID Buzz.

236
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,804
这种老车真的让人觉得
Older cars like that really make you feel like,

237
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,267
是的 如果你在开这车的时候出错
yeah, if you screw up in this thing

238
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,868
很难有其他东西能救你
there's not a lot that's going to save you.

239
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,969
不过 这正是开这样的车的乐趣所在
But that's a part of the fun with cars like these,

240
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:31,576
这些老式保时捷 以及这些专为运动打造的跑车
these older Porsches, these older purpose-built sports cars.

241
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:34,116
在某种程度上 缺乏安全感
the lack of safety in a sense

242
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:37,118
反而增添了驾驶的刺激体验
is almost what adds to the thrill of the experience

243
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:39,898
在这辆车里 根本没有任何辅助系统
and so in this car there are zero nannies

244
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:42,038
牵引力控制也没有
you have no traction control system

245
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,340
你把方向盘向左打
so you turn the wheel to the left

246
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,559
猛踩油门 车子就开始侧滑
and floor it and you are going sideways

247
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,541
这辆车的悬挂系统真的很特别
the suspension on this car is actually really interesting

248
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:54,263
首先 你肯定注意到这段视频里 它的悬挂很硬
firstly i'm sure you've noticed in this footage that it is pretty stiff

249
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:55,883
车身也很低
uh it sits very low

250
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,124
所以你会感觉到很多颠簸的路面
and so you're gonna feel a lot of those bumps

251
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:01,625
这要看个人情况 还是能接受
but It's certainly livable depending on who you are, I guess

252
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,907
还有你生活的地方
and the area you live in.

253
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:04,047
我住在新泽西
I live in New Jersey

254
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:08,509
所以显然  这里的乘坐舒适性不算很好
so obviously ride comfort is going to always not be the best

255
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,811
和其他地方比
compared to other places.

256
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:10,931
但是它是可以调节的
But it is adjustable

257
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,813
这是因为这些三段可调避震系统
and that's because these are three-way adjustable coilovers

258
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,274
由佩斯基赛车制造
made by Penske Racing.

259
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,816
他们因提供卓越的调教而闻名
And they're known for making setups for, like, you know,

260
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,158
超级跑车和运动跑车
supercars, sports cars.

261
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,999
那么这个调校到底是什么呢
And so what this setup is

262
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,140
这实际上与GT3 RS中使用的配置非常相似
is very similar to something that you'd get in, like, a GT3 RS,

263
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,921
例如
for example.

264
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,485
这个设置的一大亮点是配备了远程油液箱
One of the killer parts of this setup is having remote reservoirs

265
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:33,849
打开车后备箱 就能看到远程油液箱
that you can see by opening the rear hatch of the car.

266
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:37,212
这些远程油液箱连接着
And so you have these remote reservoirs that are connected to

267
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,878
车底的主油箱
the primary fluid tank underneath the car

268
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:44,662
通过这些液压管线 油液可在两个油箱之间循环
via these hydraulic lines that are feeding fluid back and forth.

269
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,342
所以 首先能得到的好处是更方便维护
and so the benefits you're getting is firstly maintenance

270
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:50,965
只需打开后备箱 就能轻松接触到这些油液箱
it's easier to access those reservoirs by just popping over the rear hatch

271
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,785
而且 您可以轻松调节
but then secondly you're getting easy adjustability

272
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,547
只需打开后舱盖
by just opening the rear hatch

273
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:58,288
然后调整与储液箱连接的旋钮
and adjusting the knobs connected to the reservoir

274
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:01,730
这让您可以轻松适应自己的驾驶体验
which makes it super easy to tailor your driving experience

275
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,110
以适应不同的情况
to whatever scenario you're in

276
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,413
这并不是专为超高性能赛道
this is not necessarily designed to be a super high performance

277
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,312
而设计
track vehicle

278
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,937
但由于这种配置
but because of this setup

279
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,778
还有车的重量和动力
and the weight and the power

280
00:13:13,778 --> 00:13:16,259
您完全可以带这辆车去参加赛道活动
you certainly could take this to a track day

281
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,039
而且可能会让不少人感到尴尬
and probably embarrass a lot of folks.

282
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,160
总体来说 这款车的乘坐舒适性不仅优于原版964
And so overall, you're working with ride comfort that's not only better

283
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,760
这个部分的意思在中文中未体现
than what you would

284
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,663
而且还有更高的可调性和能力
get from an original 964, but more adjustable and more capable as well.

285
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:30,104
这辆车的刹车系统也相当出色
You're also working with a very healthy brake setup in this car.

286
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:34,934
前面装有六活塞刹车钳 后面则是四活塞刹车钳
You've got six piston calipers up front, four piston calipers in the rear,

287
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:38,297
四轮都配备了大型Brembo钢制刹车盘
big steel Brembo rotors all around.

288
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,378
这样的配置可谓
And so a setup like that is what you'd find

289
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:42,859
许多高端超跑的标配
on a lot of like high-end supercars

290
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,960
近十年来的超跑普遍都采用这种配置
from like the past 10 years or so.

291
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,660
不过 这款车的刹车调节很出色
But the braking modulation is also really nice.

292
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,101
刹车也不是特别敏感
It's not super grabby

293
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:52,143
也不会像很多运动汽车那样突然刹车
and stabby like a lot of sports cars are known to be.

294
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,544
刹车非常平稳 渐渐地停止
It's very smooth and gradual

295
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:58,366
这使得它作为日常代步车更容易适应
which makes it a lot easier to live with as a daily driver

296
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,869
如果这是你想尝试的
if that's something you wanted to attempt to do.

297
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:02,230
就像我一开始提到的
So like I mentioned at the beginning

298
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,034
我觉得没有必要把它拿来和
I don't think it makes sense to try to compare this

299
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:11,179
这款车与同时期的911比较也没有意义
as an alternative to the equivalent 911 from this era.

300
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,240
但即便如此
But even with that in mind

301
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,067
我认为我们应该比较一下乐趣与这一时代911的关系
I do think we should evaluate the fun factor versus a 911 of this era

302
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:21,629
没有电动机和电池作为动力
not powered by electric motors and a battery.

303
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:23,291
这完全取决于你是谁
I think it really depends on who you are.

304
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,913
对某些人来说 没有那种声音是无所谓的
For some people, not having that noise is just not going to do

305
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:27,854
无所谓的
anything for you,

306
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:32,398
无论这辆车多么吓人和强大
no matter how scary and how capable the car is overall.

307
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:37,701
我想 这是我会为某人买的
To me, this is something I think I would love to buy for someone

308
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,962
他想体验驾驶911的感觉
who wants the feeling of driving a 911

309
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:46,787
却不想承担维护的烦恼
without having to deal with all of the maintenance responsibilities

310
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:51,004
维护这款时代的911所需的麻烦
that come with maintaining a 911 from this era.

311
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:52,086
买这款车的时候
When getting a car like this

312
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,684
你就不必操心那些事了
you're not going to have to deal with that sort of stuff.

313
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:58,607
我觉得了解这款车也是一个有趣的挑战
And I think it's also an interesting challenge to try to learn

314
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,610
去理解这种瞬间动力输出的汽车
and understand a car with this type of instantaneous power delivery

315
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,333
没有电子牵引控制
without any of the electronic traction control assists

316
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,955
及其他辅助功能
and all that fun stuff.

317
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:10,557
这与理解
It's certainly different than learning to understand

318
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:14,019
993涡轮的手动变速器大相径庭
a manual transmission 993 turbo

319
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,743
在驾驶中 你需要合理掌握换挡时机和油门控制
where you have to properly time shifts and throttle input with, you know

320
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:23,817
如果你驾驶涡轮增压的911 涡轮增压动力反应会明显
the boost of the turbos if you have a turbocharged 911, that sort of stuff.

321
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,398
这绝对是完全不同的体验
It's certainly an entirely different experience

322
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:30,639
这种体验无法与
one that you can't just compare directly to

323
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,640
传统内燃机的911直接相比
an internal combustion engine powered 911.

324
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,844
在这样的车里 你几乎很难不享受驾驶的乐趣
I think it's pretty hard to not have fun in a car like this

325
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:43,267
即使你更喜欢8000转的高转速体验
even if you would prefer having, you know, an 8,000 RPM, high revving

326
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:46,288
但这绝对不能取代手动变速器的魅力
, you know, manual transmission experience.

327
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,671
这完全不是对那种体验的替代
This is not a replacement for that

328
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:51,653
如果你的预算足够的话
but if you have a budget that allows for it

329
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,934
我觉得这真是个不错的增添
I think it's a pretty cool addition.

330
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:56,476
我觉得很多人可能会
It's something that I think a lot of people are going to be

331
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,879
对此感到怀疑
naturally very skeptical about

332
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,160
但我觉得应该尝试一下
but I think it's only right

333
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,984
在排除之前 先试试看吧
that you give it a try before ruling it out.

334
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:05,184
当你拥有这些特性时
When you have all these things

335
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:07,525
当你拥有保时捷的媒体中心
when you have the Porsche media center

336
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,368
你能感受到保时捷的操控感
you have the Porsche steering feel

337
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,009
你还能闻到保时捷那种独特的香味
you have the Porsche smell

338
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,650
就像我吉姆叔叔那些老保时捷的味道
it smells like a lot of my Uncle Jim's old Porsches.

339
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,912
这真是太疯狂了
It's actually crazy.

340
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:18,153
考虑到这些事情时
When you put all that into consideration

341
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:23,556
你就能明白价格为何如此高了
you can understand how you can get to an extremely high price point because

342
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,116
这些都是手工打造的车
these are hand-built machines.

343
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:28,118
这些可不是特斯拉Model 3
These are not Tesla Model 3s where, you know

344
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,198
你会发现在这里有些奇怪的缝隙
you'll see weird gaps here

345
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,601
以及那里的奇怪不一致
and there and weird quirky inconsistencies.

346
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:40,245
这确实有着经典德国车的感觉
This has that real OG German car feel, which is, you know

347
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,125
对某些人来说 这种感觉是无法用价格来衡量的
it's hard to put a price on that for some people.

348
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:55,659
我想我爱上这车了
I think I love this thing.

349
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:56,480
我觉得我蛮喜欢这个的
I think I love this thing.

350
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,163
这可能是我在这里测试过的最爱车型
This might be my favorite car that we've actually gotten to test here.

351
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,927
这既是车的魅力 也是体验的一部分
And it's part the car, part the experience.

352
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:08,009
我一直在想那个2008年特斯拉跑车的视频
Again, I keep throwing back to that 2008 Tesla Roadster video

353
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,093
自第一款特斯拉跑车以来 技术进步得令人赞叹
how far the technology has come since the original Tesla Roadster,

354
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,314
比如电池密度
the battery density

355
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,315
续航能力有多强
how much range you get

356
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:15,355
充电速度有多快
how fast they charge.

357
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:18,013
我还没给你看呢
I didn't even show you.

358
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,958
结束前 我要给你看最后一件事
I should show you one last thing before I wrap this up.

359
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,820
充电方式其实很简单
How you charge this is actually kind of really intuitive.

360
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,603
只需抓住它 然后拉一下
You just grab this and pull.

361
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,686
这个就可以打开
And this opens.

362
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,087
充电口就在这儿
And there's your charge port right here.

363
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,169
CCS
CCS.

364
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:32,230
直接把它插进来
Pop it right in there.

365
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,333
就像你想象的 它看起来像个油箱
Like you would expect that to be a sort of a gas tank

366
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,843
但他们想到了所有
but they've thought of everything.

367
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,085
我真的喜欢这个项目
But I love this project

368
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:46,672
因为这辆车明显是80年代的经典原版
because it's just such an obviously original, OG-looking car from the 80s,

369
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,633
其造型经典
the classic shape.

370
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,256
没人不喜欢这款911的外形
I don't think anyone's ever not liked the shape of this 911

371
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:53,939
但它有我熟悉的驾驶感觉
but then it just has what I'm familiar with

372
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,280
就是电动驾驶的体验
which is the electric driving experience

373
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,170
而且表现得相当好
and kind of does it really well.

374
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,030
这是一款超级有趣的车
This is an ultimate fun car.

375
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,891
我超级喜欢它！
I love it.

376
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,612
如果你想了解更多 可以点击下面的链接哦
I'll leave a link below if you want to check them out.

377
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,212
看这个视频的人应该都不会买这辆车
Probably nobody who actually watches this is going to go buy one of these

378
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,813
但这真的是太牛了！
but it's one of the sickest things ever

379
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,173
我很开心能体验到这一切
and I'm glad I got to experience it.

380
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,233
希望我能再试一次
Hopefully I get to try this again.

381
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:14,055
谢谢大家观看！
All right, thanks for watching.

382
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,115
下个视频再见！
Catch you in the next one.

383
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:15,296
保持联系！
Peace.
