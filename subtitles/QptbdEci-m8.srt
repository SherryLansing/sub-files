1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,910
所以Insta360新推出了Ace Pro
So Insta360 has a new Ace Pro

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,451
Ace Pro 2
the Ace Pro 2

3
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:07,094
而且前面依然有徕卡的标志 显示了合作开发的特色
and they've still got that Leica badge on the front, co-engineered.

4
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:12,638
这当然是他们的8K AI运动相机 配有可翻转的显示屏
This, of course, is their 8K AI-powered action camera with a flippy display

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,698
这样你就能看到自己了
so you can see yourself.

6
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,420
看起来更加坚固了
It looks more rugged than ever.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,441
他们给了我一张小卡片 上面写着1比1.3
They gave me this little slip, say 1 over 1.3.

8
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:23,564
这是一颗搭载徕卡镜头的8K传感器
The size of the 8K sensor with a Leica lens on it.

9
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:27,065
支持8K 30帧的视频和5000万像素照片
8K 30 frames per second video, 50 megapixel photos,

10
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:30,526
还配备了双人工智能芯片 以提升图像质量
and a dual AI chip for superior image quality.

11
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:33,327
他们声称改善了低光拍摄性能
They claim to have enhanced the low light performance.

12
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:37,929
他们声称改善了防风设计 以确保录音清晰
They claim to have enhanced the wind guard for clear audio when recording.

13
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,990
我们还可以拍摄4K 60帧
We can also shoot 4K 60 frames

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,591
我觉得对大多数人来说
which I think is actually going to be more useful for more people

15
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,251
这比8K画面更实用
than the 8K footage.

16
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:49,215
坚固耐用 防水性能可达39英尺 支持157度广角拍摄
Rugged and waterproof to 39 feet, 157 degree wide angle capture.

17
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,798
当然 我们还提供AI编辑
Of course, we've also got our AI editing

18
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,619
这个功能也集成在应用程序中
which is built into the app as well.

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,643
所以Insta360让我对比
So Insta360 actually asked me to show the footage next to

20
00:00:57,643 --> 00:00:59,564
Ace Pro 2和GoPro 13 Black的画面
the footage from the GoPro 13 Black.

21
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:02,066
这说明他们对自己产品非常有信心
That's how confident they are in their product.

22
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,927
接下来你会看到一些样品
So you're going to see some samples

23
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,269
你可以自己判断
and you can decide for yourself

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,311
当你比较图像质量时
when you see the image quality comparatively

25
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,852
在几种不同的场景中
in a couple of different scenarios.

26
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:12,033
它似乎附带了双电池包
It looks like it comes with a dual battery bundle

27
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,593
这总是很棒的
which is always kind of nice.

28
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:16,132
我想你可以选择不同的套件来订购它
I presume you can order this in a couple of different kits

29
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,274
但两个电池总会更好
but two batteries is better than one.

30
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:20,974
他们也有很好的防抖功能
They've also got very nice smoothing

31
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:24,295
还有高动态范围（HDR）技术 让画面更加清晰、易于观看
and HDR to keep everything nice and watchable.

32
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:27,215
在这里 你可以看到它们称之为'流畅稳定'
Here you can see they call it flow state stabilized.

33
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:30,436
而这个地平线锁定功能 简直就像魔法一样
And that horizon lock is basically like magic.

34
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:32,016
这看起来确实挺不一样的
This does look different.

35
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:34,816
麦克风的网罩换了个样子
The microphone grill has changed.

36
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,010
贴纸1
Sticker one.

37
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,751
贴纸2
Sticker two.

38
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,554
整个设备看起来非常耐用 几乎就像单反相机
The whole thing feels quite rugged, almost like a SLR style camera.

39
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:44,256
如果你想让显示屏保持
The display locks into place if you wanna

40
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:47,117
在常规格式 它会自动锁定
keep it locked out in its regular format

41
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:49,019
当然 它也能轻松卡入到位
but then obviously it clicks into place

42
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,280
在前置拍摄时
in the front facing scenario as well.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,301
这样你就可以轻松伸出手 看到自己的样子
So you can easily hold this out, see yourself.

44
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,923
即使你使用了一根自拍杆
And even if you have it on some sort of an extension selfie stick

45
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:57,664
你依然能看到自己
you can still see yourself on there.

46
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,046
徕卡126胜过13
Leica 126 over 13.

47
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:06,203
它还有一个副屏和一个大的录制按钮
You've also got this secondary front display and a large record button.

48
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:08,207
电源开关在另一边
Power switch over on the other side.

49
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,510
把这个翻下来
Flip this back down.

50
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,152
电池
Battery.

51
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:13,954
放在这里
Fits into this location here.

52
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:16,195
盖子会紧密封闭
And the lid kind of seals into place

53
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:19,518
防止电池进水和进尘土
in order to seal off the battery from moisture and dust.

54
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:24,820
此外 这里还有一个USB-C和microSD的专用插口
And then we have a separate door for our USB-C as well as our microSD.

55
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,442
包装里还有这些内容
Also in the package

56
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,002
一堆文件
a tremendous amount of paperwork

57
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,264
这是相机的经典现象之一
which is kind of a classic thing with cameras.

58
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,266
以前的相机一般会有比较厚的手册
Thicker booklets have historically come with cameras.

59
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,348
还有一些Insta360的贴纸
And actually, some Insta360 stickers as well.

60
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:36,848
可以想象是那些手册
Think booklets.

61
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:37,369
令人惊叹
bold.

62
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:43,234
我们配备了一根更加耐用的USB-C数据线和一些扎带
We have our USB-C cable with some cable ties, a little more robust.

63
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:46,556
另外 这里还有一个磁性连接
And remember, we have this magnetic connection,

64
00:02:46,556 --> 00:02:49,858
至少在视频的前半部分是磁性的
which at least the first portion of the clip is magnetic.

65
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,800
这样可以帮助你自动对齐
So it kind of lines it up for you

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,181
然后你只需要轻轻一按就可以了
and then you just click it in.

67
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,521
所以这既是磁性的 又有机械连接的特性
So it's both magnetic and mechanical.

68
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:56,782
要拆卸的时候
And then in order to release it

69
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,305
你需要两边抓住 然后用力拔出来
you have to grab from both sides and pull it out.

70
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,007
这样处理起来会更加爽快
It just makes it a little bit more satisfying

71
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,888
比起单一的方法 使用起来更简单一些
and a little bit easier than having just one

72
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:06,848
而不是单纯依赖机械接点
or the other just having a mechanical connection point instead

73
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:08,490
我们通过这种方式确保连接顺畅
here we make sure things are lined up

74
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,770
这样一连就能快速连接上了
and then we're in it's pretty quick

75
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,052
当然 你现在可以把它连接到不同的配件上
and of course you can now attach this to a variety of accessories

76
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:15,474
这款电池无需外部盒子
without the need for any kind of like external case

77
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:16,835
这是我们的第二块电池
here is our second battery

78
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,276
这也是套餐中的一部分
since it's part of the bundle

79
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:19,956
这个是防风罩
so this one is the wind guard

80
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:24,680
这是麦克风盖 入水时请使用它
and this is the mic cap if you're going to head into water you use this cap

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,863
如果你要在风中拍摄的话 哦
And if you're going to be filming in the wind, oh

82
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:27,643
我居然没注意到！
I didn't even notice.

83
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:30,165
这个夹子里面是泡沫
So there's foam on the inside of this clip.

84
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:31,287
这就是它的原理
So that's how that's working.

85
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,949
这不仅仅是个有孔的格栅
So it's not just a perforated grill.

86
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,389
后面还有泡沫
There's foam behind there.

87
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,450
如果你之前看过的话
And if you've seen in the past

88
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,932
说到降低风噪音
when it comes to reducing wind noise

89
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,413
你通常会用泡沫状的材料
you always have sort of like a foam

90
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,816
或者是一个夹在外面的毛绒防风罩
or a dead cat that you would clip onto the outside.

91
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,018
不过那看起来有点难看
But that's a little bit ugly.

92
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:44,120
这显然是个更简洁的解决方案
This is definitely a cleaner solution

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,300
而且它不会轻易掉下来
and it's not going to fall off

94
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,203
因为它是固定网罩的一部分
because it's part of the rigid grill.

95
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:52,381
哦 我们快速比较一下这个机身
Oh, let's do a quick comparison just of the body

96
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,303
和前一代的不同
comparative to the previous generation.

97
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,985
这就是Ace Pro
So this was the Ace Pro

98
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,686
现在我们来看看 Ace Pro 2
and now we have the Ace Pro 2.

99
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:02,210
显然 最引人注目的就是这个新的麦克风位置
Definitely the standout aspect is this new microphone location

100
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,151
和配件了
and accessory.

101
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,832
机身形态没有太大变化
It doesn't really change the form factor all that much

102
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,835
因为镜头本身就有些凸出
because the lens is protruding anyways.

103
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:11,038
我觉得把这个屏幕加进来是个不错的设计
So integrating that screen I think is a nice thing.

104
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:14,001
录制按钮现在完全是圆形的
The record button is now completely circular

105
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:17,002
不再是之前方形按钮内的红圈了
instead of just being a red circle inside of a square button.

106
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,586
显示屏的实际显示区域似乎大了一些
display looks a little bit larger not the frame of it

107
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:26,531
而且 新的电池盖表现得更好 真是超赞
but the actual active display area the new battery door is way better holy

108
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,533
这开起来真不太让人满意
so this is not very satisfying to open

109
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,076
关闭Ace Pro的电池盖
and close this the battery door on the ace pro

110
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:33,298
与新电池盖相比 感觉更好
at least comparatively the new battery door

111
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,560
发出轻微的咔嗒声
it just there's a little click

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,283
而且释放手感更加令人放心
and the release is much more confidence inspiring you hear

113
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,483
那个咔嗒声
that little click

114
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,966
是啊 他们的确改进了很多
yeah they really improved it

115
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,190
Mo现在把Ace 2 Pro拿出来了
so mo has now taken the ace 2 pro out

116
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,810
并进行了充分测试
and put it through its paces

117
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,434
我打算对比最新的GoPro拍的录像
and i am going to examine the footage

118
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:53,100
看看能不能找出区别
comparative to the latest gopro see if i can spot the differences

119
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,740
我们还聊聊
and also just talk about some of the improvements

120
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,461
他们对Ace Pro 2进行的一些改进
they've made in the ace pro 2

121
00:04:56,461 --> 00:05:03,266
因为有很多升级 像新的1/1.3传感器
because there are a number of upgrades including the new 1 over 1.3 sensor

122
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:08,108
这是8K 30帧的画面 看看这美丽的秋天色彩
this is the 8k 30 footage look at the beautiful autumn colors

123
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,249
细节非常丰富
plenty of detail here

124
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:13,009
运动相机的稳定性很不错
from an action camera stabilization as well

125
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:15,531
颜色非常鲜艳
We have extremely vibrant, I mean

126
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,271
显然 秋天的树叶确实为画面增添了许多色彩
obviously the fall leaves help with that,

127
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:22,711
颜色饱和且细节丰富
but very vibrant, saturated colors and tremendous detail.

128
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:24,052
这就是8K 30帧的画面
It's 8K 30.

129
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,572
我的显示器并不是8K 但
My display is not even 8K, but.

130
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,254
哦 你捕到了一只兔子！
Oh, you caught a rabbit.

131
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:31,514
兔子心里会想
The rabbit's like

132
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,634
你这台运动相机是干什么用的？
what are you doing with this action camera?

133
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,694
就像你正在树林里一样 兄弟
Like you're in the bush, man.

134
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,896
他现在觉得自己像是被追捕了
He thinks he's being hunted right now.

135
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:40,038
在8K画质下 最能展示出这些细节
in 8k most showcasing how

136
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,862
使用8K拍摄后 你可以在后期调整更多画面 效果更好
when you start with 8k you still got more you've got more reach in post

137
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,081
因为你可以放大到两倍
because you can go to 2x

138
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:48,464
而且效果仍然不错 完全可以使用
and it's still still good enough to use

139
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,545
对于运动相机来说 这点非常不错
which on an action camera is kind of nice

140
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:53,889
因为你希望广角 这样就不会错过精彩瞬间
because you want to be as wide as possible so you don't miss the action

141
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,430
不过在编辑的时候
but then when you're editing it

142
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,132
你可能想把人物拉得更近一些
you might want to bring people into a closer point

143
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,132
因为实在太宽了
because it's just so wide

144
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,574
而且很难看明白
and hard to tell what's going on

145
00:06:00,574 --> 00:06:03,855
使用这款摄影机 能轻松进行2倍裁剪
but when you start with ak to begin with you can easily do a 2x crop

146
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:08,742
现在咱们看到的是4K 120 怎么会有这么多叶子飘落呢？
and here we have 4k 120 How do you have so many leaves falling?

147
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,684
你把那些叶子抛到空中了
You threw those up in the air.

148
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:11,586
嗯
Yeah.

149
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,468
你现在只是在做视频壁纸
You're just making wallpapers right now.

150
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:16,129
就像视频壁纸和屏保那样
Like video wallpapers, screen savers.

151
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,572
真美！
That's beautiful.

152
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:20,774
这就是他们所称的4K清晰变焦
So this is what they call 4K clarity zoom.

153
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:22,817
这不是后期合成的效果
And this is not in post.

154
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,781
只需在屏幕上双击 就能激活4K清晰变焦
This is a double tap on the display in order to engage the 4K clarity zoom.

155
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,341
4K 30 HDR 激活HDR
4K 30 HDR, active HDR.

156
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,838
在这种情况下
Yeah, so in this case

157
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:34,879
Mo在做的就是增强图像的对比度效果
what Mo's doing is he's trying to have a ton of contrast in the image.

158
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,060
所以太阳实际上在画面中 显然会呈现过曝的效果
So the sun is actually in the frame, obviously going to be blown out

159
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,620
并且前景较暗
and a darker foreground

160
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,300
以查看它如何处理其中的阴影
to see how it deals with the shadows in the foreground.

161
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,420
这正是Insta360的核心魅力所在
This is sort of what it's all about for Insta360.

162
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,240
在Ace Pro上也差不多 Ace Pro 2更为明显
It was similar on the Ace Pro, even more so on the Ace Pro 2

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,422
突出低光表现的优势
to highlight the highlight, the low light performance.

164
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,161
这当然是不可少的部分
This is, of course

165
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,642
就是新处理系统和显而易见的新传感器的作用
where the new processing system comes in and obviously the new sensor.

166
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:00,163
大家可以看到 哇 这真是
As you can see, Wow, that's

167
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,483
现在是什么时候啊？
this is what time of day is this?

168
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:02,043
这是夜晚的场景
This is night.

169
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,745
这是说 现在大概多晚了？
This is like, how late is this?

170
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,245
这是早上五点吗？真是太晚了！
This is five in the morning?

171
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,745
哇 真是不可思议！
Damn.

172
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,007
总之 你可以明显看到这里的区别
Anyway, you can sort of spot the difference here.

173
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:12,327
还有一个额外的好处是
And the other benefit that's happening is

174
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:15,829
因为系统能获取更多信息
because the system is getting more information

175
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,970
得益于低光环境下的表现
because of the low light performance

176
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,271
它能够提供更多数据给稳定器
it's able to feed more into the stabilizer

177
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,790
识别情况的能力
the ability to discern what's going on

178
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,312
这样你能获得更稳定的画面 减少抖动
but you also end up with a more stable image with less rattles.

179
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:29,134
我想说
I mean,

180
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:29,836
没错
yeah.

181
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,336
听着 兄弟
Look, man.

182
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:35,440
显然 右侧的画面很难看清楚
Obviously, hard to see what's going on in the frame on the right,

183
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,519
这是GoPro画面
the GoPro frame.

184
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:43,024
如果图像更清晰一些
If you have more detail in the image

185
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:44,605
这有助于提高画面的稳定性
it's going to aid in the stabilization.

186
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:45,005
就这样
That's it.

187
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,247
这就是我们现在看到的情况
That's kind of what we're witnessing here.

188
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:49,029
把手势控制打开
Turn on gesture control.

189
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,091
哦 真快啊
Oh, that's quick, actually.

190
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,091
现在我能看到它在录制
Now I can see the fact that it's recording

191
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:57,053
因为前面有个红灯
because I have a red light on the front

192
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,764
我可以停止录制了
and I can go ahead and Stop the recording.

193
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:02,766
这真的很清晰又迅速
That's just really crisp and fast.

194
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,567
开始录！
Start recording.

195
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,331
非常快速 而且很简单
Very quick, easy.

196
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:10,031
暂停录制！
Stop recording.

197
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:19,278
快拍一张！
Take a photo.

198
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:20,980
非常连贯
Very, very coherent.

199
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:26,644
感觉完全没有延迟或处理时间
Like there's no lag or processing time.

200
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:27,286
开始录！
Start recording.

201
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,581
标记这个片段
Mark that clip.

202
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:33,886
暂停录制！
Stop recording.

203
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:40,773
这就是与徕卡联合研发的新款Insta360 Ace Pro 2
So that's the new Insta360 Ace Pro 2, co-engineered with Leica

204
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,994
这款运动相机现在可以以30帧录制8K视频
8K on an action camera now at 30 frames.

205
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:47,894
还有很多其他实用的功能和特色
Also, a ton of other useful functions and features.

206
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,115
支持4K120和纯视频4K60
4K 120, pure video 4K 60

207
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:54,017
我自己可能会经常使用这个
which I would probably shoot in a lot myself.

208
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:56,116
风挡设计更优
The better design on the windscreen,

209
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,038
配备大传感器 低光性能出色
the big sensor, the low light performance.

210
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,898
在评论区告诉我你们的看法！
Let me know what you guys think in the comments.

211
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,958
这会是你下一个相机选择吗？
Is this your next action camera?
